Limited-Vocab-Writing
=====================

Processing sketch for ingesting text, ranking most popular words and only display those, obscuring the remaining words.

Outputted raw text is included for limited vocabularies of 50, 200, 1000 words

I have put together PDF versions of the text, set in Baskerville.

This has all been worked on in an effort to take part in #NaNoGenMo and #NaNoWriMo
