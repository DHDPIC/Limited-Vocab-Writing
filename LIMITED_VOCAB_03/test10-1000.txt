*********** I 

****** OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ********* HIS BIRTH 

Among other public ********* in a certain town, which for many ******* it will be ******* to ******* from **********, and to which I will ****** no ********** name, there is one ********* common to most *****, great or small: to ***, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and **** which I need not trouble myself to ******, ******** as it can be of no possible *********** to the ******, in this ***** of the business at all ******; the **** of ********* whose name is ******** to the head of this chapter. 

For a long time after it was ******* into this world of ****** and trouble, by the parish *******, it remained a matter of ************ doubt whether the child would ******* to bear any name at all; in which case it is ******** more than ******** that these ******* would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being ********* within a couple of *****, they would have ********* the *********** ***** of being the most ******* and ******** ******** of *********, ****** in the ********** of any age or country. 

Although I am not disposed to ******** that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most ********* and ******** ************ that can ******** ****** a ***** being, I do mean to say that in this particular ********, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by *********** have ********.  The fact is, that there was ************ ********** in ******** Oliver to take upon himself the office of ***********, --a *********** ********, but one which ****** has rendered necessary to our **** *********; and for some time he lay ******* on a little ***** ********, rather ********* ****** between this world and the next: the ******* being ********* in ****** of the latter.  Now, if, during this brief ******, Oliver had been ********** by ******* ************, anxious *****, *********** ******, and ******* of ******** ******, he would most ********** and *********** have been ****** in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a ****** old woman, who was rendered rather ***** by an ******** ********* of ****; and a parish ******* who did such matters by ********; Oliver and Nature ****** out the point between them.  The ****** was, that, after a few *********, Oliver ********, *******, and proceeded to ********* to the ******* of the workhouse the fact of a new ****** having been *******  upon the parish, by ******* up as loud a cry as could ********** have been expected from a **** ****** who had not been ********* of that very ****** *********, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter. 

As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and ****** action of his *****, the ********* ******** which was ********** ***** over the iron ********, *******; the pale face of a young woman was raised ****** from the ******; and a ***** voice *********** *********** the words, 'Let me see the child, and die.' 

The ******* had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the ***** of his hands a **** and a *** ***********.  As the young woman spoke, he rose, and ********* to the ***'* head, said, with more ******** than might have been expected of him: 

'Oh, you must not talk about ***** yet.' 

'*** bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the *****, hastily ********** in her pocket a green glass ******, the ******** of which she had been ******* in a corner with ******* satisfaction. 

'*** bless her dear heart, when she has ***** as long as I have, sir, and had ******** children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the ****** with me, ***'** know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young **** do.' 

Apparently this *********** *********** of a ******'* ********* ****** in ********* its *** effect.  The ******* shook her head, and ********* out her hand towards the child. 

The ******* ********* it in her arms.  She ********* her cold white lips ************ on its ********; passed her hands over her face; ***** ****** round; *********; fell ****--*** died. They ****** her breast, hands, and *******; but the blood had stopped *******.  They ****** of hope and *******. They had been ********* too long. 

'It's all over, Mrs. *********!' said the ******* at last. 

'Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the *****, ******* up the **** of the green ******, which had ****** out on the ******, as she ******* to take up the child.  'Poor dear!' 

'You *****'* mind ******* up to me, if the child *****, *****,' said the *******, putting on his ****** with great ************. 'It's very ****** it _will_ be ***********. Give it a little ***** if it is.'  He put on his hat, and, ******* by the ***-**** on his way to the door, added, 'She was a ****-******* girl, too; where did she come from?' 

'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the ********'* order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had walked some distance, for her ***** were **** to ******; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.' 

The ******* ****** over the body, and raised the left hand.  'The old story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no *******-****, I see. Ah! 



The ******* gentleman walked away to ******; and the *****, having once more ******* herself to the green ******, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to ***** the ******. 

What an ********* ******* of the power of *****, young Oliver Twist was!  ******* in the ******* which had ******** ****** his only ********, he might have been the child of a ******** or a ******; it would have been hard for the ********** stranger to have ******** him his ****** ******* in society.  But now that he was ********* in the old ****** ***** which had ***** ****** in the same *******, he was ****** and ********, and fell into his place at ****--* parish *****--*** ****** of a *********--*** ******, ****-******* ******--** be ****** and ******** through the *****--******** by all, and ****** by none. 

Oliver cried *******. If he could have known that he was an ******, left to the ****** ******* of ******-******* and *********, perhaps he would have cried the ******. 





CHAPTER ** 

****** OF OLIVER *****'* ******, *********, AND BOARD 

For the next ***** or ten months, Oliver was the ****** of a ********** course of ********* and *********.  He was brought up by hand.  The ****** and ********* ********* of the ****** ****** was **** ******** by the workhouse *********** to the parish ***********.  The parish *********** inquired with ******* of the workhouse ***********, whether there was no female then ********* in 'the house' who was in a ********* to ****** to Oliver Twist, the *********** and *********** of which he stood in need.  The workhouse *********** replied with ********, that there was not. Upon this, the parish *********** ************* and ******** resolved, that Oliver should be '******,' or, in other words, that he should be ********** to a ******-********* some three miles off, where twenty or ****** other ******** ********* against the ****-****, ****** about the floor all day, without the ************* of too much **** or too much ********, under the ******** *************** of an ******* female, who received the ******** at and for the consideration of **********-********* *** small head *** week. **********-*********'* worth *** week is a good round **** for a child; a great deal may be got for **********-*********, quite enough to ******** its *******, and make it *************. The ******* female was a woman of ****** and **********; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very ******** ********** of what was good for herself. So, she ************ the ******* part of the ****** ******* to her own use, and ********* the rising ********* ********** to even a ******* ********* than was ********** ******** for them.  ******* finding in the ****** ***** a ****** still; and ******* herself a very great ************ ***********. 

********* knows the story of another ************ *********** who had a great ****** about a ***** being able to live without ******, and who ************ it so well, that he had got his own ***** down to a ***** a day, and would ************** have rendered him a very ******** and ********** ****** on nothing at all, if he had not died, ****-***-****** hours before he was to have had his first *********** **** of air.  ************* for, the ************ ********** of the female to whose ********** care Oliver Twist was ********* over, a ******* ****** ******* ******** the ********* of _her_ ******; for at the very moment when the child had ********* to ***** upon the ******** possible ******* of the ******* possible ****, it did ********** ****** in ***** and a half ***** out of ten, either that it ******** from want and cold, or fell into the fire from *******, or got ****-********* by ********; in any one of which *****, the ********* little being was ******* ******** into another world, and there ******** to the ******* it had never known in this. 

************, when there was some more than ******* *********** ******* upon a parish child who had been ********** in turning up a ********, or ************* ******* to death when there happened to be a *******--****** the latter ******** was very ******, anything *********** to a ******* being of **** ********** in the ****--*** **** would take it into their heads to ask *********** *********, or the ************ would ************ ***** their ********** to a ************.  But these ************* were ******** ******* by the ******** of the *******, and the ********* of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very ******** indeed), and the latter of whom ********** ***** ******** the parish wanted; which was very ****-**********.  Besides, the board made ********** *********** to the ****, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.  The children were **** and ***** to ******, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have! 

It cannot be expected that this ****** of ******* would ******* any very ************* or ********* ****.  Oliver *****'* ***** ******** found him a pale **** child, ******** ********** in *******, and ********* small in *************.  But nature or *********** had ********* a good ****** ****** in Oliver's breast.  It had had ****** of room to ******, ****** to the ***** **** of the *************; and perhaps to this ************ may be ********** his having any ***** *****-*** at all.  Be this as it may, however, it was his ***** ********; and he was ******* it in the ****-****** with a ****** party of two other young gentleman, who, after ************* with him in a sound *********, had been locked up for *********** ********* to be ******, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was ************ ******** by the ********** of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, ******** to **** the ****** of the ******-****. 

'Goodness ********!  Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?' said Mrs. Mann, ********* her head out of the window in ****-******** ********* of joy. '(*****, take Oliver and them two ***** upstairs, and **** 'em ********.)--** heart alive!  Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, 



Now, Mr. Bumble was a *** man, and a ********; so, ******* of ********** to this ****-******* ********** in a ******* ******, he gave the little ****** a ********** *****, and then ******** upon it a **** which could have ******** from no *** but a ******'*. 

'***, only think,' said Mrs. Mann, running ***,--*** the three boys had been ******* by this ****,--'**** think of that!  That I should have ********* that the gate was ****** on the inside, on account of them dear children!  Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.' 

Although this ********** was accompanied with a ******* that might have ******** the heart of a ******-******, it by no means ********* the 



'Do you think this ********** or ****** *******, Mrs. Mann,' inquired Mr. Bumble, ******** his cane, 'to keep the parish ******** a ******* at your ******-****, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial *******?  Are you *****, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial ********, and a ***********?' 

'I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a ******* one or two of the dear children as is so **** of you, that it was you a coming,' replied Mrs. Mann with great ********. 

Mr. Bumble had a great **** of his ********** ****** and his **********.  He had ********* the one, and ********** the other. He 



'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,' he replied in a ****** tone; 'it may be as you say; it may be.  **** the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.' 

Mrs. Mann ******* the beadle into a small parlour with a ***** floor; placed a seat for him; and *********** ********* his cocked hat and cane on the table before him.  Mr. Bumble ***** from his ******** the ************ which his walk had **********, ******* ************ at the cocked hat, and smiled.  Yes, he smiled.  ******* are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled. 

'Now don't you be ******** at what I'm a going to say,' observed Mrs. Mann, with *********** *********.  'You've had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn't ******* it.  Now, will you take a little drop of *********, Mr. Bumble?' 

'Not a drop.  Nor a drop,' said Mr. Bumble, ****** his right hand in a *********, but ****** manner. 

'I think you will,' said Mrs. Mann, who had ******* the tone of the *******, and the ******* that had accompanied it.  'Just a ****** drop, with a little cold water, and a **** of *****.' 

Mr. Bumble *******. 

'Now, just a ****** drop,' said Mrs. Mann ************. 

'What is it?' inquired the beadle. 

'Why, it's what I'm ******* to keep a little of in the house, to put into the ******* *******' *****, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner ********, and took down a ****** and glass.  'It's ***.  I'll not ******* you, Mr. *.  It's ***.' 

'Do you give the children *****, Mrs. Mann?' inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the *********** ******* of ******. 

'Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is,' replied the *****. 'I couldn't see 'em ****** before my very eyes, you know sir.' 

'No'; said Mr. Bumble ***********; 'no, you could not.  You are a ****** woman, Mrs. Mann.'  (Here she set down the glass.)  'I shall take a early opportunity of ********** it to the board, Mrs. Mann.' (He drew it towards him.)  'You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.'  (He ******* the ***-***-*****.) '*--* drink your ****** with ************, Mrs. Mann'; and he ********* half of it. 

'And now about business,' said the beadle, taking out a ******** ******-****.  'The child that was ****-******** Oliver Twist, is **** year old **-***.' 

'Bless him!' interposed Mrs. Mann, ********* her left eye with the corner of her *****. 

'And *************** a ******* ****** of ten pound, which was afterwards ********* to twenty pound.  *************** the most ***********, and, I may say, ********'*** ********* on the part of this parish,' said Bumble, 'we have never been able to ******** who is his father, or what was his ******'* **********, name, or condition.' 

Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment's **********, 'How comes he to have any name at all, then?' 

The beadle drew himself up with great *****, and said, 'I ******** it.' 

'You, Mr. Bumble!' 

'I, Mrs. Mann.  We name our ********* in ************ order. The last was a *,--*******, I ***** him. This was a *,--*****, I ***** _him_. The next one comes will be *****, and the next *******.  I have got ***** ready made to the end of the ********, and all the way through it again, when we come to *.' 

'Why, you're quite a ******** *********, sir!' said Mrs. Mann. 

'Well, well,' said the beadle, ********* ********* with the **********; 'perhaps I may be.  Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.' He ******** the ***-***-*****, and added, 'Oliver being now too old to ****** here, the board have determined to have him back into the house.  I have come out myself to take him there.  So let me see him at once.' 

'I'll ***** him directly,' said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose.  Oliver, having had by this time as much of the ***** coat of **** which ********* his face and hands, *******, as could be ******** off in one *******, was led into the room by his ********** ***********. 

'Make a *** to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann. 

Oliver made a ***, which was ******* between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table. 

'Will you go along with me, Oliver?' said Mr. Bumble, in a ******** 



Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great *********, when, glancing ******, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the ******'* chair, and was shaking her **** at him with a ******* countenance.  He took the **** at once, for the **** had been too often ********* upon his body not to be ****** ********* upon his 



'Will she go with me?' inquired poor Oliver. 

'No, she can't,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'But ***'** come and see you 



This was no very great *********** to the child.  Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a ***** of feeling great ****** at going away.  It was no very ********* matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes.  ****** and ****** ***-***** are great ********** if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very ********* indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave him a ******** ********, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and ******, less he should **** too ****** when he got to the workhouse. With the ***** of bread in his hand, and the little *****-***** parish *** on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never ******* the ***** of his ****** years.  And yet he burst into an ***** of ******** *****, as the *******-**** closed after him.  Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his ********** in the great **** world, **** into the *****'* heart for the first time. 

Mr. Bumble walked on with long *******; little Oliver, firmly ******** his ****-***** ****, ******* ****** him, ********* at the end of every quarter of a **** whether they were 'nearly there.' To these ************** Mr. Bumble returned very brief and ******** *******; for the ********* ********* which ***-***-***** ******* in some ****** had by this time **********; and he was once again a beadle. 

Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely ********* the ********** of a second ***** of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had ****** him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, ******* him it was a board night, ******** him that the board had said he was to ****** before it *********. 

Not having a very ******* ******* ****** of what a live board was, Oliver was rather ********* by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.  He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a *** on the head, with his cane, to **** him up: and another on the back to make him ******: and ******* him to follow, ********* him into a large *****-****** room, where ***** or ten *** gentlemen were sitting round a table.  At the top of the table, seated in an ***-***** rather ****** than the rest, was a ************ *** gentleman with a very round, red 



'*** to the board,' said Bumble.  Oliver ******* away two or three tears that were ********* in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, *********** ***** to that. 

'What's your name, boy?' said the gentleman in the high chair. 

Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him *******: and the beadle gave him another *** behind, which made him cry.  These two ****** made him answer in a very low and ********** voice; ********* a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a ****. Which was a ******* way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ****. 

'Boy,' said the gentleman in the high chair, 'listen to me. You know you're an ******, I suppose?' 

'What's that, sir?' inquired poor Oliver. 

'The boy _is_ a ****--* thought he was,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 

'Hush!' said the gentleman who had spoken first.  'You know you've got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't 



'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, ******* ********. 

'What are you ****** for?' inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  And to be sure it was very *************.  What _could_ the boy be ****** for? 

'I hope you say your ******* every night,' said another gentleman in a ***** voice; 'and pray for the people who **** you, and take care of ***--**** a *********.' 

'Yes, sir,' ********* the boy.  The gentleman who spoke last was ************* right.  It would have been very like a *********, and a ************ good ********* too, if Oliver had ****** for the people who *** and took care of _him_. But he ****'*, because nobody had ****** him. 

'Well!  You have come here to be ********, and ****** a ****** trade,' said the ***-***** gentleman in the high chair. 

'So you'll ***** to **** ***** to-morrow morning at six o'clock,' added the ***** one in the white waistcoat. 

For the *********** of both these ********* in the one ****** ******* of ******* *****, Oliver ***** low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ****; where, on a *****, hard bed, he ****** himself to sleep.  What a ***** ************ of the ****** **** of *******!  They let the paupers go to sleep! 

Poor Oliver!  He little thought, as he lay ******** in happy *************** of all ****** him, that the board had that very day arrived at a ******** which would ******** the most ******** ********* over all his ****** ********.  But they had.  And this was it: 

The ******* of this board were very ****, deep, ************* men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ******** ***** would never have **********--*** poor people ***** it!  It was a ******* place of public ************* for the ****** *******; a ****** where there was nothing to pay; a public *********, ******, tea, and ****** all the year round; a ***** and ****** *******, where it was all **** and no work.  '***!' said the board, looking very knowing; 'we are the ******* to set this to ******; we'll stop it all, in no time.'  So, they *********** the ****, that all poor people should have the *********** (for they would ****** nobody, not they), of being ******* by a ******* ******* in the house, or by a quick one out of it.  With this view, they ********** with the *****-***** to lay on an ********* ****** of water; and with a ****-****** to ****** ************ small ********** of *******; and ****** three ***** of **** ***** a day, with an ***** twice a week, and half a **** of *******.  They made a great many other **** and ****** ***********, having ********* to the ladies, which it is not necessary to ******; ****** ********* to ******* poor ******* people, in *********** of the great ******* of a suit in *******' *******; and, ******* of ********** a man to ******* his family, as they had *********** done, took his family away from him, and made him a ********!  There is no saying how many ********** for ******, under these last two heads, might have started up in all ******* of society, if it had not been ******* with the workhouse; but the board were ****-****** men, and had ******** for this **********.  The ****** was *********** from the workhouse and the *****; and that frightened 



For the first six months after Oliver Twist was *******, the ****** was in full *********.  It was rather ********* at first, in *********** of the ******** in the **********'* bill, and the ********* of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which ********* ******* on their ******, ******** *****, after a week or ***'* *****.  But the number of workhouse ******* got **** as well as the paupers; and the board were in *********. 

The room in which the boys were ***, was a large stone ****, with a ****** at one end: out of which the master, ******* in an ***** for the purpose, and ******** by one or two women, ****** the ***** at *********.  Of this ******* *********** each boy had one *********, and no ****--****** on ********* of great public *********, when he had two ****** and a quarter of bread besides. 

The ***** never wanted *******.  The boys ******** them with their ****** till they ***** again; and when they had ********* this ********* (which never took very long, the ****** being nearly as large as the *****), they would sit ******* at the ******, with such ***** eyes, as if they could have ******** the very ****** of which it was ********; ********* themselves, meanwhile, in ******* their ******* most ***********, with the view of catching up any ***** ******** of ***** that might have been cast *******.  Boys have ********* ********* *********. Oliver Twist and his companions ******** the ******** of **** ********** for three months: at last they got so ********* and **** with ******, that one boy, who was **** for his age, and ****'* been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small ****-****), ****** ****** to his companions, that unless he had another ***** of ***** *** ****, he was afraid he might some night ****** to eat the boy who ***** next him, who happened to be a ****** ***** of ****** age.  He had a ****, ****** eye; and they ********** ******** him. A ******* was held; **** were cast who should walk up to the master after ****** that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist. 

The evening arrived; the boys took their ******.  The master, in his ****'* *******, ********* himself at the ******; his ****** ********** ****** themselves behind him; the ***** was ****** out; and a long ***** was said over the short *******.  The ***** ***********; the boys whispered each other, and ****** at Oliver; while his next ********* ****** him.  Child as he was, he was desperate with ******, and ******** with misery.  He rose from the table; and ********* to the master, ***** and ***** in hand, said: ******** ******* at his own 



'Please, sir, I want some more.' 

The master was a ***, ******* man; but he turned very pale. He ***** in ********* astonishment on the small ***** for some *******, and then ***** for ******* to the ******.  The ********** were ********* with wonder; the boys with fear. 

'What!' said the master at length, in a ***** voice. 

'Please, sir,' replied Oliver, 'I want some more.' 

The master ***** a blow at Oliver's head with the *****; ******** him in his arm; and ******** ***** for the beadle. 

The board were sitting in ****** ********, when Mr. Bumble ****** into the room in great **********, and ********** the gentleman in the high chair, said, 

'Mr. ********, I beg your ******, sir!  Oliver Twist has asked for 



There was a ******* *****.  ****** was ******** on every countenance. 

'For _more_!' said Mr. ********.  '******* yourself, Bumble, and answer me **********.  Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had ***** the ****** ******** by the *******?' 

'He did, sir,' replied Bumble. 

'That boy will be hung,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  'I know that boy will be hung.' 

Nobody ************ the ********* gentleman's opinion.  An ******** ********** took place.  Oliver was ******* into instant ***********; and a bill was next morning ****** on the outside of the gate, ******** a ****** of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish.  In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were ******* to any man or woman who wanted an ********** to any trade, business, or *******. 

'I never was more ********* of anything in my life,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he ******* at the gate and read the bill next morning: 'I never was more ********* of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.' 

As I purpose to show in the ****** whether the white *********** gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps *** the interest of this ********* (********* it to ******* any at all), if I ******** to **** just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent *********** or no. 





CHAPTER *** 

******* HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR ******* A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A ******** 

For a week after the ********** of the ******* and ******* ******* of ****** for more, Oliver remained a close ******** in the dark and ******** room to which he had been ********* by the ****** and mercy of the board.  It *******, at first sight not ************ to suppose, that, if he had *********** a ******** feeling of ******* for the ********** of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have *********** that **** **********'* ********* *********, once and for ever, by ***** one end of his ******-************ to a **** in the wall, and ********* himself to the other.  To the *********** of this ****, however, there was one ********: ******, that ******-************* being ******* ******** of ******, had been, for all ****** times and ****, ******* from the ***** of paupers by the ******* order of the board, in ******* *********: ******** given and ********** under their hands and *****.  There was a still ******* ******** in Oliver's ***** and ************.  He only cried ******** all day; and, when the long, ****** night came on, ****** his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and ********* in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and **** ****** with a ***** and *******, and drawing himself ****** and ****** to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard ******* were a ********** in the ***** and ********** which ********** him. 

Let it not be supposed by the ******* of 'the ******,' that, during the ****** of his ******** *************, Oliver was ****** the ******* of ********, the pleasure of society, or the ********** of ********* ***********.  As for ********, it was **** cold *******, and he was ******* to ******* his ********* every morning under the ****, in a stone ****, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who ********* his catching cold, and ****** a ******** ********* to ******* his *****, by repeated ************ of the cane.  As for society, he was carried every other day into the **** where the boys *****, and there ******** ******* as a public ******* and *******.  And so far from being ****** the ********** of ********* ***********, he was ****** into the same ********* every evening at ******-****, and there ********* to listen to, and ******* his mind with, a ******* ************ of the boys, ********** a ******* ******, ******* ******** by ********* of the board, in which they ********* to be made good, ********, *********, and ********, and to be ******* from the **** and ***** of Oliver Twist: whom the ************ ********** set forth to be under the ********* ********* and ********** of the ****** of **********, and an ******* ****** from the *********** of the very Devil himself. 

It ******* one morning, while Oliver's ******* were in this ********** and *********** state, that Mr. Gamfield, *******-*****, went his way down the High Street, ****** ********** in his mind his **** and means of ****** certain ******* of ****, for which his ******** had become rather ********.  Mr. ********'* most ******** ******** of his ******** could not ***** them within full five pounds of the ******* ******; and, in a ******* of ************ ***********, he was *********** ********** his ****** and his ******, when passing the workhouse, his eyes *********** the bill on the gate. 

'**--*!' said Mr. Gamfield to the ******. 

The ****** was in a state of ******** ***********: *********, ********, whether he was ******** to be ******* with a *******-***** or two when he had disposed of the two ***** of **** with which the little **** was *****; so, without ******** the word of *******, he ****** ******. 

Mr. Gamfield growled a ****** *********** on the ****** *********, but more ************ on his eyes; and, running after him, ******** a blow on his head, which would ********** have ****** in any ***** but a ******'*.  Then, catching hold of the ******, he gave his *** a sharp ******, by way of gentle ******** that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round.  He then gave him another blow on the head, just to **** him till he came back again.  Having ********* these ************, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill. 

The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having ********* himself of some ******** ********** in the *****-****.  Having ********* the little ******* between Mr. Gamfield and the ******, he smiled ******** when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was ******* the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he ******* the ********; for five pounds was just the *** he had been ******* for; and, as to the boy with which it was **********, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the ******* of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a **** small *******, just the very thing for ******** ******.  So, he ***** the bill through again, from ********* to end; and then, ******** his *** *** in ***** of ********, ******** the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 

'This here boy, sir, wot the parish ***** to '*******,' said Mr. 



'**, my man,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a ************* smile.  'What of him?' 

'If the parish ***** like him to ***** a right pleasant trade, in a good '********* ********-*******' *******,' said Mr. Gamfield, 'I ***** a '*******, and I am ready to take him.' 

'Walk in,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr. Gamfield having ******** behind, to give the ****** another blow on the head, and another ****** of the ***, as a ******* not to run away in his *******, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him. 

'It's a ***** trade,' said Mr. ********, when Gamfield had again ****** his wish. 

'Young boys have been ********* in ******** before now,' said another 



'That's ****** they ****** the ***** afore they *** it in the ******** to make 'em come down again,' said Gamfield; 'that's all *****, and no *****; ****** ***** ain't *' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only ***** him to sleep, and that's wot he *****.  Boys is **** ********, and **** ****, ***'*'***, and there's ******* like a good *** ***** to make 'em come down **** a run.  It's ****** too, ***'*'***, ******, even if ****'** ***** in the ********, ******** their feet ***** 'em ******** to ********** ***********.' 

The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much ****** by this ***********; but his ***** was ******** ******* by a look from Mr. ********.  The board then proceeded to ******** among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words '****** of ***********,' 'looked well in the ********,' 'have a ******* ****** *********,' were alone *******.  These only ******* to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very ********** repeated with great 



At length the ********** ******; and the ******* of the board, having resumed their ***** and their *********, Mr. ******** said: 

'We have considered your ***********, and we don't ******* of it.' 

'Not at all,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 

'********* not,' added the other *******. 

As Mr. Gamfield did ****** to ****** under the slight ********** of having ******* three or four boys to death already, it ******** to him that the board had, perhaps, in some ************* *****, taken it into their heads that this ********** ************ ought to ********* their ***********. It was very ****** their ******* **** of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to ****** the ******, he ******* his *** in his hands, and walked slowly from the 



'So you won't let me have him, ***'*'***?' said Mr. Gamfield, ******* near the door. 

'No,' replied Mr. ********; 'at least, as it's a ***** business, we think you ought to take something less than the ******* we *******.' 

Mr. ********'* countenance **********, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said, 

'****'** you give, ***'*'***?  Come!  Don't be too hard on a poor man. ****'** you give?' 

'I should say, three pound ten was ******,' said Mr. ********. 

'Ten ********* too much,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 

'Come!' said Gamfield; 'say four pound, ***'*'***.  Say four pound, and you've got *** of him for good and all.  There!' 

'Three pound ten,' repeated Mr. ********, firmly. 

'Come!  I'll ***** the ****'******, ***'*'***,' ***** Gamfield. 'Three pound *******.' 

'Not a ******** more,' was the **** reply of Mr. ********. 

'You're desperate hard upon me, ***'*'***,' said Gamfield, ********. 

'****!  ****!  ********!' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 'He'd be ***** with nothing at all, as a *******. Take him, you ***** fellow!  He's just the boy for you.  He ***** the stick, now and then: **'** do him good; and his board *****'* come very *********, for he ****'* been ******* since he was born.  Ha!  ha!  ha!' 

Mr. Gamfield gave an **** look at the faces round the table, and, ********* a smile on all of them, gradually ***** into a smile himself. The ******* was made.  Mr. Bumble, was at once ********** that Oliver Twist and his ********** were to be ******** before the magistrate, for ********* and ********, that very *********. 

In ********* of this *************, little Oliver, to his ********* astonishment, was ******** from *******, and ******* to put himself into a ***** *****.  He had hardly ******** this very ******* ********* ***********, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a ***** of *****, and the ******* ********* of two ****** and a quarter of bread. At this ********** sight, Oliver began to cry very *********: thinking, not ***********, that the board must have determined to **** him for some ****** purpose, or they never would have ***** to ****** him up in that way. 

'Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your **** and be ********,' said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of ********** *********. 'You're a going to be made a '******** of, Oliver.' 

'A ********, sir!' said the child, trembling. 

'Yes, Oliver,' said Mr. Bumble.  'The kind and ******* gentleman which is so many ******* to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to '********' you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the ******* to the parish is three pound ***!--***** pound ten, ******!--******* ********--*** ******* and ***** *********!--*** all for a ******* ****** which nobody can't love.' 

As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after ********** this ******* in an ***** voice, the tears ****** down the poor *****'* face, and he ****** ********. 

'Come,' said Mr. Bumble, ******** less *********, for it was ********** to his feelings to ******* the effect his ********* had ********; 'Come, Oliver!  **** your eyes with the ***** of your ******, and don't cry into your *****; that's a very ******* action, Oliver.'  It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already. 

On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble ********** Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be ***********, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which *********** Oliver ******** to ****: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle ****, that if he ****** in either particular, there was no ******* what would be done to him. When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and ********** by Mr. Bumble to **** there, until he came back to ***** 



There the boy remained, with a *********** heart, for half an hour.  At the ********** of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, ********* with the cocked hat, and said *****: 

'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'  As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a **** and *********** look, and added, in a low voice, 'Mind what I told you, you young ******!' 

Oliver ****** ********** in Mr. Bumble's face at this ******** ************* ***** of *******; but that gentleman ********* his ******** any remark *********, by ******* him at once into an ********* room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great window.  Behind a ****, sat two old gentleman with ******** heads: one of whom was ******* the *********; while the other was ********, with the *** of a pair of ********-***** **********, a small piece of ********* which lay before him.  Mr. ******** was standing in front of the **** on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a ********* ****** face, on the other; while two or three *****-******* men, in ***-*****, were ******** about. 

The old gentleman with the ********** gradually ***** off, over the little bit of *********; and there was a short *****, after Oliver had been ********* by Mr. Bumble in front of the ****. 

'This is the boy, your worship,' said Mr. Bumble. 

The old gentleman who was ******* the ********* raised his head for a moment, and ****** the other old gentleman by the ******; *********, the ****-********* old gentleman **** up. 

'Oh, is this the boy?' said the old gentleman. 

'This is him, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.  '*** to the magistrate, my 



Oliver roused himself, and made his best *********.  He had been *********, with his eyes fixed on the ***********' ******, whether all ****** were born with that white ***** on their heads, and were ****** from *********** on that account. 

'Well,' said the old gentleman, 'I suppose he's **** of 



'He ***** on it, your worship,' replied Bumble; giving Oliver a *** *****, to ******** that he had better not say he didn't. 

'And he _will_ be a *****, will he?' inquired the old gentleman. 

'If we was to **** him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd run away ************, your worship,' replied Bumble. 

'And this man that's to be his ******--***, ***--***'** ***** him well, and **** him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?' said the old 



'When I says I will, I means I will,' replied Mr. Gamfield ********. 

'You're a ***** *******, my friend, but you look an ******, ****-******* man,' said the old gentleman: turning his ********** in the direction of the ********* for Oliver's *******, whose ********** countenance was a ******* ******* ******* for *******.  But the magistrate was half ***** and half ********, so he couldn't ********** be expected to ******* what other people did. 

'I hope I am, sir,' said Mr. Gamfield, with an **** ****. 

'I have no doubt you are, my friend,' replied the old gentleman: ****** his ********** more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the 



It was the ******** moment of Oliver's ****.  If the ******** had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have ****** his *** into it, and ****** the **********, and Oliver would have been *********** hurried off.  But, as it ******* to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his **** for it, without finding it; and ********* in the course of his ****** to look straight before him, his **** *********** the pale and ********* face of Oliver Twist: who, ******* all the ********** looks and ******* of Bumble, was ********* the ********* countenance of his ****** master, with a ******* expression of ****** and fear, too ******** to be ********, even by a ****-***** magistrate. 

The old gentleman stopped, laid down his ***, and looked from Oliver to Mr. ********; who ********* to take ***** with a ******** and *********** ******. 

'My boy!' said the old gentleman, 'you look pale and *******. What is the matter?' 

'Stand a little away from him, Beadle,' said the other magistrate: laying ***** the paper, and ******* forward with an expression of interest.  'Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.' 

Oliver fell on his knees, and ******** his hands together, ****** that they would order him back to the dark ****--**** they would ****** ***--**** ***--**** him if they *******--****** than send him away with that dreadful man. 

'Well!' said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most ********** *********.  'Well! of all the artful and ********* ******* that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most ****-********.' 

'Hold your ******, Beadle,' said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given **** to this ******** *********. 

'I beg your *******'* ******,' said Mr. Bumble, *********** of having heard ******.  'Did your worship speak to me?' 

'Yes.  Hold your ******.' 

Mr. Bumble was ********* with astonishment.  A beadle ******* to hold his ******!  A ***** **********! 

The old gentleman in the ********-***** ********** looked at his companion, he nodded *************. 

'We ****** to ******** these **********,' said the old gentleman: ******* ***** the piece of ********* as he spoke. 

'I hope,' ********* Mr. ********:  'I hope the *********** will not form the opinion that the *********** have been ****** of any ******** *******, on the *********** ********* of a child.' 

'The *********** are not called upon to ********* any opinion on the matter,' said the second old gentleman *******.  'Take the boy back to the workhouse, and ***** him ******.  He ***** to want it.' 

That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most ********** and ********* ********, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and ********* into the *******. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy *******, and said he ****** he might come to good; ********* Mr. Gamfield replied, that he ****** he might come to him; which, although he ****** with the beadle in most matters, would **** to be a wish of a ******* opposite ***********. 

The next morning, the public were once ******** that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be **** to anybody who would take ********** of him. 





CHAPTER ** 

OLIVER, BEING ******* ANOTHER PLACE, ***** HIS FIRST ***** INTO PUBLIC 



In great ********, when an ************ place cannot be ********, either in **********, *********, *********, or **********, for the young man who is ******* up, it is a very ******* ****** to send him to ***.  The board, in ********* of so **** and ******** an *******, took ******* together on the ********** of ******** off Oliver Twist, in some small ******* ****** ***** to a good ********* ****.  This ********* itself as the very best thing that could ******** be done with him: the *********** being, that the ******* would **** him to death, in a ******* ****, some day after ******, or would ***** his ****** out with an iron ***; both ******** being, as is pretty ********* known, very ********* and common *********** among gentleman of that *****.  The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more ******** the ********** of the step appeared; so, they came to the ********** that the only way of ********* for Oliver ***********, was to send him to *** without *****. 

Mr. Bumble had been ********** to make various *********** *********, with the view of finding out some ******* or other who wanted a *****-*** without any friends; and was ********* to the workhouse to *********** the ****** of his *******; when he *********** at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the ********* undertaker. 

Mr. Sowerberry was a **** *****, *****-******* man, ******* in a suit of ********** black, with ****** ****** ********* of the same ******, and ***** to answer.  His features were not ********* ******** to **** a smiling ******, but he was in ******* rather given to ************ ********.  His step was *******, and his face ********* ****** **********, as he ******** to Mr. Bumble, and shook him ********* by the hand. 

'I have taken the ******* of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,' said the undertaker. 

'You'll make your *******, Mr. Sowerberry,' said the beadle, as he thrust his ***** and ********** into the ********* *****-*** of the undertaker: which was an ********* little ***** of a ****** coffin.  'I say you'll make your *******, Mr. Sowerberry,' repeated Mr. Bumble, ******* the undertaker on the shoulder, in a ******** manner, with his 



'Think so?' said the undertaker in a tone which half ******** and half ******** the *********** of the *****.  'The ****** ******* by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.' 

'So are the *******,' replied the beadle: with ********* as near an ******** to a laugh as a great ******** ought to ******* in. 

Mr. Sowerberry was much ******* at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without *********.  'Well, well, Mr. Bumble,' he said at length, 'there's no ******* that, since the new ****** of ******* has come in, the ******* are something ******** and more ******* than they used to be; but we must have some ******, Mr. Bumble. ****-******** ****** is an ********* *******, sir; and all the iron ******* come, by *****, from **********.' 

'Well, well,' said Mr. Bumble, 'every trade has its *********. A **** ****** is, of course, *********.' 

'Of course, of course,' replied the undertaker; 'and if I don't get a ****** upon this or that particular *******, why, I make it up in the ****-***, you ***--**! he! he!' 

'Just so,' said Mr. Bumble. 

'Though I must say,' continued the undertaker, ******** the ******* of ************ which the beadle had ***********: 'though I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to ******* against one very great ************: which is, that all the ***** people go off the ********.  The people who have been better off, and have **** ***** for many years, are the first to **** when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four ****** over ***'* *********** ***** a great **** in ***'* *******: ********** when one has a family to ******* for, 



As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the ******** *********** of an ***-**** man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather ****** to ****** a ********** on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it ********* to change the subject.  Oliver Twist being ********* in his mind, he made him his *****. 

'By the ***,' said Mr. Bumble, 'you don't know anybody who ***** a boy, do you?  A porochial '*******, who is at present a ****-******; a *********, as I may say, round the porochial throat?  ******* *****, Mr. Sowerberry, ******* *****?'  As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three ******** **** upon the words 'five pounds':  which were ******* ******* in ***** ******** of ******** ****. 

'*****!' said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the ****-***** ****** of his ******** coat; 'that's just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about.  You ****--**** me, what a very ******* ****** this is, Mr. Bumble!  I never ******* it before.' 

'Yes, I think it rather pretty,' said the beadle, glancing ******* ********* at the large ***** ******* which *********** his coat. 'The die is the same as the porochial ****--*** Good ********* ******* the sick and ******* man. The board presented it to me on *******'* morning, Mr. Sowerberry.  I put it on, I ********, for the first time, to ****** the ******* on that ******* *********, who died in a ******* at ********.' 

'I *********,' said the undertaker. 'The **** brought it in, "Died from ******** to the cold, and want of the common *********** of life," didn't they?' 

Mr. Bumble nodded. 

'And they made it a ******* *******, I think,' said the undertaker, 'by ****** some words to the effect, that if the ********* officer had--' 

'****!  *******!' interposed the beadle.  'If the board ******** to all the ******** that ******** ******* talk, ****'* have enough to do.' 

'Very true,' said the undertaker; 'they would indeed.' 

'******,' said Mr. Bumble, ******** his cane *******, as was his wont when ******* into a passion: '****** is ***********, ******, ********** 



'So they are,' said the undertaker. 

'They haven't no more ********** nor ********* ******* about 'em than that,' said the beadle, ******** his ******* **************. 

'No more they have,' ********** the undertaker. 

'I ******* 'em,' said the beadle, ******* very red in the face. 

'So do I,' rejoined the undertaker. 

'And I only wish **'* a **** of the *********** sort, in the house for a week or two,' said the beadle; 'the ***** and *********** of the board would soon bring their ****** down for 'em.' 

'Let 'em alone for that,' replied the undertaker.  So saying, he smiled, ***********: to **** the rising ***** of the ********* parish 



Mr Bumble ****** off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the *****; ***** from his ******** the ************ which his **** had **********; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a ****** voice: 

'Well; what about the boy?' 

'Oh!' replied the undertaker; 'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the ****'* *****.' 

'***!' said Mr. Bumble.  'Well?' 

'Well,' replied the undertaker, 'I was thinking that if I pay so much towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and **--* think I'll take the boy myself.' 

Mr. Bumble ******* the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the ********.  Mr. Sowerberry was ******** with the board for five minutes; and it was ******** that Oliver should go to him that evening 'upon ******'--* ****** which means, in the case of a parish **********, that if the master find, upon a short *****, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much **** into him, he shall have him for a **** of years, to do what he ***** with. 

When little Oliver was taken before 'the gentlemen' that evening; and ******** that he was to go, that night, as ******* *****-*** to a ******-*****'*; and that if he ********** of his *********, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to ***, there to be *******, or ******* on the head, as the case might be, he ******* so little *******, that they by common ******* ********** him a ******** young ******, and ******* Mr. Bumble to ****** him *********. 

Now, although it was very ******* that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of ******** astonishment and ****** at the ******** ****** of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular ********.  The ****** fact was, that Oliver, ******* of ********** too little feeling, ********* rather too much; and was in a **** way of being *******, for life, to a state of ****** ********* and ********** by the ill ***** he had received. He heard the **** of his ***********, in ******* silence; and, having had his ******* put into his ****--***** was not very ********* to carry, ******** as it was all ********* within the ****** of a ***** paper ******, about half a foot ****** by three ****** ****--** ****** his *** over his eyes; and once more ********* himself to Mr. Bumble's coat ****, was led away by that ********* to a new scene of *********. 

For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very *****, as a beadle always should: and, it being a ***** day, little Oliver was ********** ********** by the ****** of Mr. Bumble's coat as they **** open, and ********* to great ********* his ******* waistcoat and **** ***** ****-********.  As they drew near to their ***********, however, Mr. Bumble thought it ********* to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for ********** by his new master: which he *********** did, with a fit and ******** air of ******** *********. 

'Oliver!'  said Mr. Bumble. 

'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, ********* voice. 

'**** that *** off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.' 

Although Oliver did as he was *******, at once; and passed the back of his ********** hand ******* across his eyes, he left a **** in them when he looked up at his *********.  As Mr. Bumble ***** ******* upon him, it ****** down his *****. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort, but it was an ************ one. *********** his other hand from Mr. Bumble's he covered his face with both; and **** until the tears ****** out from between his **** and **** *******. 

'Well!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and ******* at his little ****** a look of ******* *********.  'Well!  Of _all_ the **************, and *****-******** boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are 



'No, no, sir,' ****** Oliver, ******** to the hand which held the ****-***** cane; 'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is **--**--' 

'So what?' inquired Mr. Bumble in *********. 

'So ******, sir!  So very ******!' cried the child.  '********* ***** me.  Oh! sir, don't, don't pray be ***** to me!'  The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion's face, with tears of real *****. 

Mr. Bumble ******** Oliver's ******* and ******** look, with some astonishment, for a few *******; ****** three or four times in a ***** manner; and after ********* something about 'that *********** *****,' **** Oliver *** his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence. 

The undertaker, who had just put up the ******** of his shop, was making some ******* in his ***-**** by the light of a most *********** ****** candle, when Mr. Bumble entered. 

'***!' said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and ******* in the ****** of a word; 'is that you, Bumble?' 

'No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,' replied the beadle.  'Here! I've brought the boy.'  Oliver made a ***. 

'Oh! that's the boy, is it?' said the undertaker:  raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. 'Mrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?' 

Mrs. Sowerberry ******* from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, then, ********-** woman, with a ******** 



'My dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry, *************, 'this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.'  Oliver ***** again. 

'Dear me!' said the **********'* wife, 'he's very small.' 

'Why, he _is_ rather small,' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his ***** that he was no ******; 'he is small. There's no ******* it.  But he'll ****, Mrs. **********--**'** ****.' 

'Ah!  I **** say he will,' replied the lady *********, 'on our ******** and our drink.  I see no ****** in parish children, not I; for they always **** more to keep, than they're worth. However, men always think they know best. There!  Get downstairs, little *** *' *****.'  With this, the **********'* wife opened a side door, and ****** Oliver down a ***** ****** of stairs into a stone ****, **** and dark: ******* the ****-**** to the ****-******, and *********** 'kitchen'; ******* sat a ********** girl, in ***** down at ****, and **** ******* ********* very much out of ******. 

'Here, Charlotte,' said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, 'give this boy some of the cold **** that were put by for ****.  He ****'* come home since the morning, so he may go without 'em.  I **** say the boy isn't too ****** to eat '**--*** you, boy?' 

Oliver, whose eyes had ********* at the ******* of ****, and who was trembling with ********* to ****** it, replied in the ********; and a ******** of ****** broken ******** was set before him. 

I wish some ****-*** ***********, whose **** and drink turn to **** within him; whose blood is ***, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist ********* at the ****** ****** that the dog had *********. I wish he could have ********* the ******** ******* with which Oliver **** the **** ******* with all the ******** of ******.  There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the *********** making the same sort of **** himself, with the same ******. 

'Well,' said the **********'* wife, when Oliver had ******** his ******: which she had ******** in silent ******, and with ******* ******** of his ****** ********: 'have you done?' 

There being nothing ******* within his *****, Oliver replied in the 



'Then come with me,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a *** and dirty ****, and ******* the way upstairs; 'your ***'* under the *******.  You don't mind ******** among the *******, I suppose? But it *****'* much matter whether you do or don't, for you can't sleep ******** else. Come; don't keep me here all night!' 

Oliver ******** no longer, but ****** followed his new ********. 





CHAPTER * 

OLIVER ******* WITH NEW **********.  GOING TO A ******* FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE ***** AN ************ ****** OF HIS ******'* BUSINESS 

Oliver, being left to himself in the **********'* shop, set the **** down on a *******'* *****, and ***** ******* about him with a feeling of *** and *****, which many people a good deal ***** than he will be at no loss to understand.  An ********** coffin on black ********, which stood in the ****** of the shop, looked so gloomy and *****-**** that a cold ******* came over him, every time his eyes ******** in the direction of the ****** object: from which he almost expected to see some ********* form slowly **** its head, to ***** him mad with ******. Against the wall were ******, in ******* *****, a long *** of *** ****** cut in the same *****: looking in the *** light, like ****-********** ****** with their hands in their ******** pockets. ******-******, ***-*****, ******-****** *****, and ****** of black *****, lay ********* on the floor; and the wall behind the ******* was ********** with a ****** ************** of two ***** in very ***** **********, on **** at a large ******* door, with a ****** drawn by four black ******, *********** in the distance. The shop was close and ***.  The ********** seemed ******* with the ***** of *******.  The ****** beneath the ******* in which his ***** ******** was thrust, looked like a grave. 

Nor were these the only ****** feelings which ********* Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how ******* and ******** the best of us will sometimes feel in such a *********. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.  The ****** of no ****** ********** was fresh in his mind; the ******* of no ***** and ****-********** face **** ******* into his heart. 

But his heart was heavy, ***************; and he ******, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be **** in a **** and ******* sleep in the ********** ground, with the **** ***** ****** gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to ****** him in his sleep. 

Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud ******* at the outside of the ****-****: which, before he could ****** on his clothes, was repeated, in an ***** and ********* manner, about ******-**** times. When he began to **** the *****, the legs ********, and a voice began. 

'Open the door, will yer?' cried the voice which ******** to the legs which had ****** at the door. 

'I will, directly, sir,' replied Oliver: ******* the *****, and turning the key. 

'I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?' said the voice through the 



'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'How old are yer?' inquired the voice. 

'Ten, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'Then I'll **** yer when I get in,' said the voice; 'you just see if I don't, that's all, my ****'** ****!' and having made this ******** promise, the voice began to *******. 

Oliver had been too often ********* to the ******* to which the very ********** ************ just ******** ***** *********, to ********* the ******** doubt that the ***** of the voice, ******* he might be, would ****** his ******, most **********. He drew back the ***** with a trembling hand, and opened the door. 

For a second or two, Oliver ******* up the street, and down the street, and over the way: ********* with the ****** that the *******, who had addressed him through the ***-****, had walked a few ***** off, to **** himself; for nobody did he see but a *** *******-***, sitting on a **** in front of the house, ****** a ***** of bread and ******: which he cut into ******, the **** of his mouth, with a *****-*****, and then ******** with great *********. 

'I beg your ******, sir,' said Oliver at length: seeing that no other ******* made his appearance; 'did you *****?' 

'I ******,' replied the *******-***. 

'Did you want a coffin, sir?' inquired Oliver, **********. 

At this, the *******-*** looked ********* ******; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut ***** with his ********* in that 



'Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, ****'**?' said the *******-***, in ************: ********** from the top of the ****, meanwhile, with ******** *******. 

'No, sir,' rejoined Oliver. 

'I'm ****** Noah Claypole,' said the *******-***, 'and you're under me. Take down the ********, yer **** young *******!' With this, Mr. Claypole ************ a **** to Oliver, and entered the shop with a ********* air, which did him great ******.  It is ********* for a *****-******, *****-**** *****, of ********* make and heavy countenance, to look ********* under any circumstances; but it is more ********** so, when ********** to these ******** *********** are a red nose and ****** ******. 

Oliver, having taken down the ********, and broken a **** of glass in his effort to ******* away beneath the ****** of the first one to a small ***** at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was ********** ******** by Noah: who having ******** him with the ********* that 'he'd ***** it,' ************ to help him.  Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. ******* afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared.  Oliver having 'caught it,' in ********** of ****'* **********, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to *********. 

'Come near the fire, Noah,' said Charlotte.  'I ***** a **** little bit of ***** for you from ******'* *********.  Oliver, shut that door at ****** ****'* back, and take them **** that I've put out on the ***** of the *****-***.  There's your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make *****, for ****'** want you to mind the shop. *'** hear?' 

'*'** hear, ****'**?' said Noah Claypole. 

'***, Noah!' said Charlotte, 'what a *** creature you are!  Why don't you let the boy alone?' 

'Let him alone!' said Noah.  'Why ********* **** him alone enough, for the matter of that.  Neither his father nor his mother will ever ********* with him.  All his ********* let him have his own way pretty well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He! he! he!' 

'Oh, you ***** soul!' said Charlotte, ******** into a ****** laugh, in which she was ****** by Noah; after which they both looked ********** at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat ********* on the box in the ******* corner of the room, and *** the ***** ****** which had been ********* ******** for him. 

Noah was a *******-***, but not a workhouse ******.  No ******-***** was he, for he could ***** his ********* all the way back to his *******, who ***** hard by; his mother being a ***********, and his father a ******* *******, ********** with a ****** ***, and a ******* ******* of ********-********* and an *********** ********.  The ****-**** in the ************* had long been in the ***** of ******** Noah in the public streets, with the *********** ******** of '********,' '*******,' and the like; and Noah had ****** them without reply.  But, now that ******* had cast in his way a ******** ******, at whom even the ******* could point the ****** of *****, he retorted on him with interest.  This ******* ******** **** for *************.  It ***** us what a beautiful thing ***** nature may be made to be; and how *********** the same ******* ********* are ********* in the ****** **** and the ******** *******-***. 

Oliver had been ********** at the **********'* some three ***** or a *****.  Mr. and Mrs. **********--*** shop being shut **--**** taking their ****** in the little ****-*******, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several *********** ******* at his wife, said, 

'My dear--'  He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a ********** ************ ******, he stopped short. 

'Well,' said Mrs. Sowerberry, *******. 

'Nothing, my dear, nothing,' said Mr. Sowerberry. 

'***, you *****!' said Mrs. Sowerberry. 

'Not at all, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry ******.  'I thought you didn't want to hear, my dear.  I was only going to say--' 

'Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,' interposed Mrs. Sowerberry.  'I am nobody; don't ******* me, pray.  _I_ don't want to ******* upon your *******.'  As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an ********** laugh, which ********** violent ************. 

'But, my dear,' said Sowerberry, 'I want to ask your ******.' 

'No, no, don't ask mine,' replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an ********* manner: 'ask somebody ****'*.'  Here, there was another ********** laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much.  This is a very common and ****-******** *********** course of *********, which is often very *********. It at once ******* Mr. Sowerberry to *******, as a ******* ******, to be ******* to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most ******* to hear.  After a short ********, the ********** was most ********** ********. 

'It's only about young Twist, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry. 'A very ****-******* boy, that, my dear.' 

'He need be, for he **** enough,' observed the lady. 

'There's an expression of ********** in his face, my dear,' resumed Mr. Sowerberry, 'which is very ***********.  He would make a ********** ****, my love.' 

Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of ************ **********.  Mr. Sowerberry ******** it and, without ******** time for any *********** on the good ****'* part, proceeded. 

'I don't mean a ******* **** to ****** *****-** people, my dear, but only for ********'* ********.  It would be very new to have a **** in **********, my dear.  You may ****** upon it, it would have a ****** 



Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of ***** in the *********** way, was much struck by the ******* of this ****; but, as it would have been ************ her ******* to have said so, under ******** circumstances, she merely inquired, with much *********, why such an ******* ********** had not presented itself to her *******'* mind before?  Mr. Sowerberry ******* ********* this, as an ************ in his ***********; it was ******** determined, *********, that Oliver should be at once ********* into the ********* of the trade; and, with this view, that he should ********* his master on the very next occasion of his ******** being ********. 

The occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after ********* next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and ********** his cane against the *******, drew forth his large ******** ******-****: from which he ******** a small ***** of paper, which he ****** over to Sowerberry. 

'***!' said the undertaker, glancing over it with a ****** countenance; 'an order for a coffin, eh?' 

'For a coffin first, and a porochial ******* afterwards,' replied Mr. Bumble, ********* the ***** of the ******** ******-****: which, like himself, was very *********. 

'******,' said the undertaker, looking from the ***** of paper to Mr. Bumble.  'I never heard the name before.' 

Bumble shook his head, as he replied, '********* people, Mr. Sowerberry; very *********.  *****, too, I'm afraid, sir.' 

'*****, eh?' exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a *****.  'Come, that's too 



'Oh, it's *********,' replied the beadle.  '**********, Mr. Sowerberry!' 

'So it is,' ********** the undertaker. 

'We only heard of the family the night before last,' said the beadle; 'and we *******'* have known anything about them, then, only a woman who ****** in the same house made an *********** to the porochial ********* for them to send the porochial ******* to see a woman as was very bad.  He had gone out to ******; but his '******** (which is a very ****** lad) sent 'em some ******** in a ********-******, *******.' 

'Ah, there's **********,' said the undertaker. 

'**********, indeed!' replied the beadle.  'But what's the ***********; what's the ********** ********* of these ******, sir?  Why, the ******* ***** back word that the ******** won't suit his ****'* *********, and so she ****'* take **--**** she ****'* take it, sir!  Good, strong, ********* ********, as was given with great ******* to two ***** ********* and a ****-******, only a week ******--**** 'em for nothing, with a *******'-****** **,--*** he ***** back word that she ****'* take it, sir!' 

As the ******** presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he struck the ******* ******* with his cane, and became ******* with 



'Well,' said the undertaker, 'I **--***--***--' 

'Never did, sir!' ********** the beadle.  'No, nor nobody never did; but now she's dead, **'** got to **** her; and that's the direction; and the sooner it's done, the better.' 

Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of ********* **********; and ******** out of the shop. 

'Why, he was so *****, Oliver, that he ****** even to ask after you!' said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he ****** down the 



'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the *********; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere ************ of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice. 

He *****'* ***** taken the trouble to ****** from Mr. Bumble's glance, however; for that ***********, on whom the ********** of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong **********, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon ***** the subject was better *******, until such time as he should be firmly ***** for ***** years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus *********** and ******* ********. 

'Well,' said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, 'the sooner this *** is done, the better.  Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your ***, and come with me.'  Oliver ******, and followed his master on his ************ *******. 

They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and ******* ********* part of the town; and then, ******** down a narrow street more dirty and ********* than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their ******.  The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and ******** by people of the ******* *****: as their ********* appearance would have ************ *******, without the ********** ********* ******** by the ******* looks of the few men and women who, with ****** arms and ****** half *******, ************ ******* along.  A great many of the ********* had ****-******; but these were fast closed, and ********** away; only the ***** ***** being *********.  Some houses which had become ******** from age and *****, were ********* from falling into the street, by **** ***** of **** ****** against the walls, and firmly ******* in the road; but even these ***** **** seemed to have been ******** as the ******* ****** of some ********* ********, for many of the ***** ****** which ******** the place of door and window, were ******** from their *********, to ****** an ******** **** enough for the passage of a ***** body.  The ****** was ******** and ******. The very ****, which here and there lay ********** in its **********, were ******* with ******. 

There was neither ******* nor ****-****** at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, ******* his way ********** through the dark passage, and ******* Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker ******* to the top of the first ****** of stairs.  ********* against a door on the *******, he ****** at it with his ********. 

It was opened by a young girl of ******** or ********.  The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room *********, to know it was the ********* to which he had been ********.  He ******* in; Oliver followed him. 

There was no fire in the room; but a man was *********, ************, over the empty *****.  An old woman, too, had drawn a low ***** to the cold ******, and was sitting ****** him. There were some ****** children in another corner; and in a small ******, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old *******. Oliver ********* as he cast his eyes ****** the place, and crept ************* ****** to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a ******. 

The man's face was **** and very pale; his hair and ***** were *******; his eyes were *********.  The old *****'* face was ********; her two ********* teeth ********* over her under ***; and her eyes were bright and ********.  Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so like the **** he had seen outside. 

'Nobody shall go near her,' said the man, starting ******** up, as the undertaker ********** the ******. 'Keep back! **** you, keep back, if you've a life to lose!' 

'********, my good man,' said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its ******.  '********!' 

'I tell you,' said the man:  ********* his hands, and ******** ********* on the *****,--'* tell you I won't have her put into the ground.  She couldn't rest there.  The ***** would ***** ***--*** eat ***--*** is so **** away.' 

The undertaker ******* no reply to this ******; but ********* a **** from his pocket, ***** down for a moment by the side of the body. 

'Ah!' said the man: ******** into tears, and ******* on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; '***** down, ***** ****--***** round her, every one of you, and **** my words!  I say she was ******* to death. I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her ***** were starting through the ****.  There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the ****--** the dark!  She couldn't even see her ********'* faces, though we heard her ******* out their *****. I ****** for her in the streets: and they sent me to ******. When I came back, she was *****; and all the blood in my heart has ***** up, for they ******* her to death.  I ***** it before the God that saw it! They ******* her!'  He ****** his hands in his hair; and, with a loud ******, ****** ********** upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the **** ******** his lips. 

The ********* children cried ********; but the old woman, who had ******** remained as quiet as if she had been ****** **** to all that passed, ******* them into silence.  Having ********** the ****** of the man who still remained ******** on the ground, she ******** towards the 



'She was my ********,' said the old woman, ******* her head in the direction of the ******; and speaking with an ******* ****, more ******* than even the presence of death in such a place. '****, ****! Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and *****!  ****, ****!--** think of it; it's as good as a ****--** good as a ****!' 

As the wretched creature ******* and ******** in her ******* *********, the undertaker turned to go away. 

'Stop, stop!' said the old woman in a loud whisper.  'Will she be ****** to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?  I laid her out; and I must walk, you know.  Send me a large *****: a good **** one: for it is ****** cold.  We should have **** and ****, too, before we go!  Never mind; send some *****--**** a **** of bread and a *** of water.  Shall we have some bread, dear?' she said eagerly: catching at the **********'* coat, as he once more moved towards the door. 

'Yes, yes,' said the **********,'** course.  Anything you like!' He ********** himself from the old *****'* *****; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away. 

The next day, (the family having been meanwhile ******** with a ****-******** **** and a piece of ******, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the ********* *****; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to *** as *******.  An old black ***** had been ****** over the **** of the old woman and the man; and the **** coffin having been ******* down, was ******* on the shoulders of the *******, and carried into the street. 

'Now, you must put your best *** ********, old lady!' whispered Sowerberry in the old *****'* ear; 'we are rather late; and it won't do, to keep the ********* *******.  **** on, my ***,--** quick as you 



Thus ********, the ******* ******* on under their light ******; and the two ******** kept as near them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good ***** pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his ******'*, ran by the side. 

There was not so great a ********* for ******** as Mr. Sowerberry had ***********, however; for when they reached the ******* corner of the ********** in which the ******* grew, and where the parish ****** were made, the ********* had not arrived; and the *****, who was sitting by the ******-**** fire, seemed to think it by no means ********** that it might be an hour or so, before he came.  So, they put the **** on the ***** of the grave; and the two ******** ****** ********* in the **** ****, with a cold rain ********* down, while the ****** boys whom the ********* had ********* into the ********** ****** a ***** game at ****-***-**** among the **********, or ****** their ********** by ******* ********* and ******** over the coffin.  Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being ******** friends of the *****, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper. 

At length, after a ***** of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the *****, were seen running towards the grave. Immediately afterwards, the ********* appeared: putting on his ******** as he came along.  Mr. Bumble then ******** a boy or two, to keep up ***********; and the ******** gentleman, having read as much of the ****** ******* as could be ********** into four minutes, gave his ******** to the *****, and walked away again. 

'Now, Bill!' said Sowerberry to the *****-******. '**** up!' 

It was no very ********* ****, for the grave was so full, that the ********* coffin was within a few feet of the *******.  The *****-****** ********* in the earth; ******* it ******* down with his feet: ********** his *****; and walked off, followed by the boys, who ******** very loud ********** at the *** being over so soon. 

'Come, my good fellow!' said Bumble, ******* the man on the back. 'They want to shut up the ****.' 

The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his ******* by the grave side, started, raised his head, ****** at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few *****; and fell down in a *****.  The ***** old woman was too much ******** in ********* the loss of her ***** (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him ****** out of the **********, locked the gate, and ******** on their different ****. 

'Well, Oliver,' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, 'how do you like 



'Pretty well, thank you, sir' replied Oliver, with ************ **********.  'Not very much, sir.' 

'Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,' said Sowerberry. 'Nothing when you _are_ used to it, my boy.' 

Oliver ********, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.  But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard. 





CHAPTER ** 

OLIVER, BEING ****** BY THE ****** OF NOAH, ****** INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ********** HIM 

The month's ***** over, Oliver was ******** ***********.  It was a **** ****** ****** just at this time.  In ********** ******, ******* were looking up; and, in the course of a few *****, Oliver ******** a great deal of **********.  The ******* of Mr. **********'* ********* ***********, ******** even his most ******** *****.  The ****** *********** *********** no ****** at which ******* had been so *********, or so ***** to ****** *********; and many were the ******** *********** which little Oliver ******, in a ***-**** ******** down to his knees, to the ************* ********** and ******* of all the ******* in the town.  As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his ***** *********** too, in order that he might ******* that ********** of ********* and full ******* of ***** which was ********* to a ******** undertaker, he had many ************* of ********* the beautiful *********** and ********* with which some ******-****** people bear their ****** and ******. 

For ********; when Sowerberry had an order for the ****** of some **** old lady or gentleman, who was ********** by a great number of ******* and ******, who had been perfectly ************ during the previous *******, and whose ***** had been ****** ************* even on the most public *********, they would be as happy among themselves as need **--***** ******** and *********--********** together with as much ******* and ******, as if nothing ******** had happened to ******* them.  ********, too, **** the loss of their ***** with the most ****** ********. *****, again, put on ***** for their ********, as if, so far from ******** in the **** of ******, they had made up their ***** to ****** it as ******** and ********** as possible.  It was **********, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in ******** of ******* during the ******** of *********, ********* almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite ******** before the ***-******** was over.  All this was very pleasant and ********* to see; and Oliver ****** it with great **********. 

That Oliver Twist was moved to *********** by the ******* of these good people, I cannot, although I am his **********, ********* to ****** with any ****** of **********; but I can most ********** say, that for many months he continued ****** to ****** to the ********** and ***-********* of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his ******** was roused by seeing the new boy ******** to the black stick and *******, while he, the old one, remained ********** in the ******-*** and ********.  Charlotte ******* him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his ******* *****, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a **** of ******** on the other, Oliver was not ********** as *********** as the ****** *** was, when he was shut up, by *******, in the ***** ********** of a *******. 

And now, I come to a very ********* passage in Oliver's history; for I have to ****** an ***, slight and *********** perhaps in appearance, but which ********** ******** a ******** change in all his ****** ********* and ***********. 

One day, Oliver and Noah had ********* into the kitchen at the usual ******-****, to ******* upon a small ***** of ******--* pound and a half of the ***** end of the ****--**** Charlotte being called out of the way, there ****** a brief ******** of time, which Noah Claypole, being ****** and *******, considered he could not ******** ****** to a ******** purpose than *********** and *********** young Oliver Twist. 

****** upon this ******** *********, Noah put his feet on the *****-*****; and ****** Oliver's hair; and ******** his ears; and ********* his opinion that he was a '*****'; and *********** ********* his ********* of coming to see him ******, ******** that ********* ***** should take place; and entered upon various ****** of ***** *********, like a ********* and ***-*********** *******-*** as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah ********* to be more ********* still; and in his *******, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be *****.  He got rather ********. 

'****'**,' said Noah, '***'* your mother?' 

'She's dead,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say anything about her to me!' 

Oliver's ****** rose as he said this; he ******** quickly; and there was a ******* ******* of the mouth and ********, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the ********* ********* of a violent fit of ******. Under this ********** he returned to the ******. 

'What did she die of, ****'**?' said Noah. 

'Of a broken heart, some of our old ****** told me,' replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than ********* Noah. 'I think I know what it must be to die of that!' 

'*** ** *** *** ***, right *** *****, ****'**,' said Noah, as a **** ****** down Oliver's *****.  'What's set you a ********** now?' 

'Not _you_,' replied Oliver, *******. 'There; that's enough. Don't say anything more to me about her; ***'* better not!' 

'Better not!' exclaimed Noah. 'Well!  Better not!  ****'**, don't be ********.  _Your_ mother, too!  She was a **** '** she was.  Oh, ***!' And here, Noah nodded his head ************; and ****** up as much of his small red nose as ******** action could ******* together, for the 



'Yer know, ****'**,' continued Noah, ********** by Oliver's silence, and speaking in a ******* tone of ******** pity: of all ***** the most ********: 'Yer know, ****'**, it can't be ****** now; and of course yer couldn't help it then; and I am very ***** for it; and I'm sure we all are, and pity yer very much.  But yer must know, ****'**, yer mother was a ******* *****-**** bad '**.' 

'What did you say?' inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly. 

'A ******* *****-**** bad '**, ****'**,' replied Noah, ******. 'And it's a great deal better, ****'**, that she died when she did, or else ***'* have been hard ********* in *********, or ***********, or hung; which is more ****** than either, isn't it?' 

******* with ****, Oliver started up; ********* the chair and table; ****** Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his ****, till his teeth ********* in his head; and ********** his whole force into one heavy blow, ****** him to the ground. 

A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, ****, ******** creature that ***** ********* had made him.  But his ****** was roused at last; the ***** ****** to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast ******; his attitude was *****; his eye bright and *****; his whole person changed, as he stood ******* over the ******** ********* who now lay ********* at his feet; and ****** him with an ****** he had never known before. 

'He'll murder me!' ********* Noah.  'Charlotte!  ******!  Here's the new boy a ********* of me!  Help! help!  Oliver's gone mad! 



****'* ****** were ********* to, by a loud ****** from Charlotte, and a ****** from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom ****** into the kitchen by a ****-****, while the latter paused on the ********* till she was quite certain that it was ********** with the ************ of ***** life, to come further down. 

'Oh, you little ******!' ******** Charlotte: ******* Oliver with her ****** force, which was about ***** to that of a ********** strong man in ************ good ********.  'Oh, you little **-*****-***, ***-**-****, ***-*** *******!'  And between every ********, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: ************ it with a ******, for the ******* of society. 

*********'* **** was by no means a light one; but, **** it should not be ********* in ******* Oliver's *****, Mrs. Sowerberry ******* into the kitchen, and ******** to hold him with one hand, while she ********* his face with the other. In this ********** position of *******, Noah rose from the ground, and ********* him behind. 

This was rather too violent ******** to last long.  When they were all ******* out, and could **** and beat no longer, they ******* Oliver, ********** and ********, but nothing *******, into the ****-******, and there locked him up.  This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry **** into a chair, and burst into tears. 

'Bless her, she's going off!' said Charlotte.  'A glass of water, Noah, dear.  Make *****!' 

'Oh!  Charlotte,' said Mrs. Sowerberry:  speaking as well as she could, through a ********** of breath, and a *********** of cold water, which Noah had ****** over her head and shoulders.  'Oh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been ******** in our ****!' 

'Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am,' was the reply.  I only hope ****'** ***** master not to have any more of these dreadful *********, that are born to be ********* and ******* from their very ******. Poor Noah!  He was all but ******, ma'am, when I come in.' 

'Poor fellow!' said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking ********* on the 



Noah, whose top *********-****** might have been ********* on a ***** with the ***** of Oliver's head, ****** his eyes with the inside of his ****** while this ************* was ******** upon him, and ********* some ********* tears and ******. 

'What's to be done!' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.  'Your ******'* not at home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll **** that door down in ten minutes.'  Oliver's ******** ******* against the bit of ****** in question, rendered this ********* ****** ********. 

'Dear, dear!  I don't know, ma'am,' said Charlotte, 'unless we send for the ******-********.' 

'Or the ***********,' ********* Mr. Claypole. 

'No, no,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: ********** herself of Oliver's old friend.  'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your ***!  Make *****!  You can hold a ***** to that black eye, as you run along. **'** keep the ******** down.' 

Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his ******* *****; and very much it ********** the people who were out walking, to see a *******-*** ******* through the streets ****-****, with no *** on his head, and a *****-***** at his eye. 





CHAPTER *** 

OLIVER ********* ********** 

Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his ******** pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the *********-****. Having ****** here, for a minute or so, to ******* a good burst of **** and an ******** show of tears and ******, he ******* ****** at the ******; and presented such a ****** face to the **** ****** who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but ****** faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment. 

'Why, what's the matter with the boy!' said the old ******. 

'Mr. Bumble!  Mr. Bumble!' cried Noah, with ****-******** ******: and in ***** so loud and ********, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but ******* him so much that he ****** into the **** without his cocked ***,--***** is a very ******* and ********** ************: as ******* that even a beadle, ***** upon a sudden and ******** *******, may be ********* with a ********* ********** of loss of ****-**********, and ************* of ******** *******. 

'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!' said Noah:  'Oliver, ***,--****** has--' 

'What?  What?' interposed Mr. Bumble: with a ***** of pleasure in his ******** eyes. 'Not run away; he ****'* run away, has he, Noah?' 

'No, sir, no.  Not run away, sir, but he's turned *******,' replied Noah. 'He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then ******.  Oh! what dreadful pain it is! 

Such *****, please, sir!'  And here, Noah ******* and ******* his body into an ********* ******* of ***-**** *********; ******* giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and ********** ***** of Oliver Twist, he had ********* ****** ******** ****** and ******, from which he was at that moment ********* the ******* *******. 

When Noah saw that the intelligence he ************ perfectly ********* Mr. Bumble, he ******** ********** effect *********, by ********* his dreadful ****** ten times ****** than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat ******** the ****, he was more ****** in his ************ than ever: ******* ********** it ****** ********* to ******* the notice, and ***** the ***********, of the gentleman 



The gentleman's notice was very soon *********; for he had not walked three *****, when he turned ******* round, and inquired what that young *** was ******* for, and why Mr. Bumble did not ****** him with something which would ****** the ****** of ******* ************ so **********, an *********** *******? 

'It's a poor boy from the ****-******, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble, 'who has been nearly ********--*** but ********, ***,--** young Twist.' 

'By ****!' exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short.  'I knew it!  I felt a strange ************ from the very first, that that ********* young ****** would come to be hung!' 

'He has ******** *********, sir, to murder the female *******,' said Mr. Bumble, with a face of **** ********. 

'And his ******,' interposed Mr. Claypole. 

'And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?' added Mr. Bumble. 

'No! he's out, or he would have ******** him,' replied Noah. 'He said he wanted to.' 

'Ah!  Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?' inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. 

'Yes, sir,' replied Noah.  'And please, sir, ****** ***** to know whether Mr. Bumble can ***** time to step up there, directly, and **** ***--'***** ******'* out.' 

'Certainly, my boy; certainly,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling ********, and ******* ****'* head, which was about three ****** ****** than his own.  'You're a good ***--* very good boy. Here's a ***** for you.  Bumble, just step up to **********'* with your cane, and see what's best to be done. Don't ***** him, Bumble.' 

'No, I will not, sir,' replied the beadle.  And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, ******** to their *****'* satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole ****** themselves with all ***** to the **********'* shop. 

Here the position of ******* had not at all ********.  Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to ****, with ************ ******, at the ******-****.  The ******** of his ******** as ******* by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so ********* a nature, that Mr. Bumble ****** it ******* to ******, before opening the door.  With this view he gave a **** at the outside, by way of *******; and, then, ******** his mouth to the *******, said, in a deep and ********** tone: 





'Come; you let me out!' replied Oliver, from the inside. 

'Do you know this here voice, Oliver?' said Mr. Bumble. 

'Yes,' replied Oliver. 

'Ain't you afraid of it, sir?  Ain't you *-********* while I speak, sir?' said Mr. Bumble. 

'No!' replied Oliver, ******. 

An answer so different from the one he had expected to ******, and was in the ***** of *********, ********* Mr. Bumble not a little.  He ******* back from the *******; drew himself up to his full ******; and looked from one to another of the three **********, in **** 



'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,' said Mrs. Sowerberry. 

'No boy in half his ****** could ******* to speak so to you.' 

'It's not *******, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep **********.  'It's ****.' 

'What?' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. 

'****, ma'am, ****,' replied Bumble, with ***** ********. 'You've ****-*** him, ma'am.  You've raised a ********** soul and ****** in him, ma'am ********** a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are ********* ************, will tell you.  What have paupers to do with soul or ******?  It's quite enough that we let 'em have live ******.  If you had kept the boy on *****, ma'am, this would never have happened.' 

'Dear, dear!' ********** Mrs. Sowerberry, ******* raising her eyes to the kitchen *******: 'this comes of being *******!' 

The ********** of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had ********* of a ******* ******** upon him of all the dirty **** and **** which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of ******** and ****-******** in her *********** ********* under Mr. Bumble's heavy **********.  Of which, to do her justice, she was ****** ********, in thought, word, or 



'Ah!' said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the ****** for a day or so, till he's a little ******* down; and then to take him out, and keep him on ***** all through the **************.  He comes of a bad family. ********* *******, Mrs. Sowerberry!  Both the ***** and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against ************ and pain that would have ****** any ****-******** woman, ***** before.' 

At this point of Mr. Bumble's *********, Oliver, just ******* enough to know that some ******** was being made to his mother, *********** *******, with a violence that rendered every other sound *********. Sowerberry returned at this ********.  Oliver's ******* having been ********* to him, with such ************* as the ladies thought best ********** to ***** his ***, he ******** the ******-**** in a *********, and ******* his ********** ********** out, by the ******. 

Oliver's clothes had been **** in the ******* he had received; his face was ******* and *********; and his hair ********* over his ********. The ***** ***** had not ***********, however; and when he was ****** out of his ******, he ******* ****** on Noah, and looked quite 



'Now, you are a **** young fellow, ain't you?' said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a *****, and a box on the ear. 

'He called my mother *****,' replied Oliver. 

'Well, and what if he did, you little ********** ******?' said Mrs. Sowerberry.  'She ******** what he said, and worse.' 

'She didn't' said Oliver. 

'She did,' said Mrs. Sowerberry. 

'It's a lie!' said Oliver. 

Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a ***** of tears. 

This ***** of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no ***********.  If he had ********* for one instant to ****** Oliver most ********, it must be quite clear to every *********** ****** that he would have been, ********* to all ********** in ******** of ********* ***********, a *****, an ********* *******, an ********* creature, a **** ********* of a man, and various other ********* ********** too ******** for ******* within the ****** of this chapter.  To do him justice, he was, as far as his power ****--** was not very *********--****** disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife ******** him. The ***** of tears, however, left him no ********; so he at once gave him a ********, which ********* even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's ********** *********** of the ********* cane, rather ***********.  For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a **** and a ***** of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various ******* outside the door, by no means ************* to the ****** of his mother, looked into the room, and, ****** the ***** and ********* of Noah and Charlotte, ******* him upstairs to his ****** bed. 

It was not until he was left alone in the silence and ********* of the gloomy ******** of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day's ********* may be supposed ****** to have awakened in a mere child.  He had listened to their ****** with a look of ********; he had ***** the **** without a cry: for he felt that ***** ******** in his heart which would have kept down a ****** to the last, though they had ******* him alive.  But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, ****** his face in his hands, **** such tears as, God send for the ****** of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to **** out before him! 

For a long time, Oliver remained ********** in this attitude. The candle was ******* low in the ****** when he rose to his feet. Having ***** ********** round him, and listened ********, he gently ***** the ********** of the door, and looked ******. 

It was a cold, dark night.  The ***** seemed, to the boy's eyes, ******* from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the ****** ******* ****** by the ***** upon the ground, looked ********** and *****-****, from being so still. He softly ******** the door.  Having ******* himself of the ******** light of the candle to *** up in a handkerchief the few ******** of ******* ******* he had, sat himself down upon a *****, to **** for morning. 

With the first *** of light that ********* through the ******** in the ********, Oliver *****, and again ******** the door.  One ***** look ******--*** moment's ***** of **********--** had closed it behind him, and was in the open street. 

He looked to the right and to the left, ********* ******* to ***. 

He ********** to have seen the *******, as they went out, ******* up the hill.  He took the same *****; and ******** at a ******** across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on. 

Along this same ********, Oliver ****-********** he had ******* ****** Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the ****. His way lay directly in front of the *******. His heart beat quickly when he ********* himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so.  Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on. 

He reached the house.  There was no appearance of its ******* ******** at that early hour.  Oliver stopped, and ****** into the ******.  A child was ******* one of the little ****; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and ********* the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though ******* than himself, he had been his little friend and ********.  They had been ******, and *******, and shut up together, many and many a time. 

'Hush, ****!' said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his **** arm between the ***** to ***** him.  'Is any one up?' 

'Nobody but me,' replied the child. 

'You ****'* say you saw me, ****,' said Oliver.  'I am running away. They beat and ***-*** me, ****; and I am going to **** my *******, some long way off.  I don't know where.  How pale you are!' 

'I heard the doctor tell them I was *****,' replied the child with a ***** smile.  'I am very glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't 



'Yes, yes, I will, to say ****-*'** to you,' replied Oliver. 'I shall see you again, ****.  I know I shall!  You will be well and happy!' 

'I hope so,' replied the child.  'After I am dead, but not before.  I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I ***** so much of Heaven, and ******, and kind faces that I never see when I am *****. **** me,' said the child,  ******** up the low gate, and ******** his little arms round Oliver's neck. '****-*'**, dear!  God bless you!' 

The ******** was from a young *****'* lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard ******* upon his head; and through the ********* and **********, and ******** and *******, of his after life, he never once ****** it. 





CHAPTER **** 

OLIVER ***** TO LONDON.  HE ********** ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN 

Oliver reached the ***** at which the **-**** **********; and once more ****** the ****-****.  It was ***** o'clock now. Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and *** behind the ******, by turns, till ****: ******* that he might be pursued and *********.  Then he sat down to rest by the side of the *********, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and *** to live. 

The stone by which he was seated, ****, in large **********, an ********** that it was just ******* miles from that spot to London. The name awakened a new ***** of ***** in the boy's mind. 

******!--**** great *****!--******--*** even Mr. ******--***** ever find him there!  He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of ****** need want in London; and that there were **** of living in that **** ****, which those who had been **** up in country ***** had no **** of.  It was the very place for a ******** boy, who must die in the streets unless some one ****** him. As these things passed through his thoughts, he ****** upon his feet, and again walked forward. 

He had ********** the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he *********** how much he must ******* *** he could hope to ***** his place of ***********. As this consideration forced itself upon him, he ********* his pace a little, and ********* upon his means of ******* there.  He had a ***** of bread, a ****** *****, and two ***** of *********, in his ******.  He had a ***** ***--* **** of **********'* after some ******* in which he had ********* himself more than ********** ****--** his pocket. 'A ***** *****,' thought Oliver, 'is a very *********** thing; and so are two ***** of ****** *********; and so is a *****; but they are small ***** to a *****-**** miles' walk in ****** time.'  But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were ********* ready and ****** to point out his ************, were ****** at a loss to ******* any ******** **** of *********** them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little ****** over to the other shoulder, and ******* on. 

Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time ****** nothing but the ***** of *** bread, and a few ******** of water, which he ****** at the *******-***** by the ****-****.  When the night came, he turned into a ******; and, ******** close under a ***-****, determined to lie there, till morning.  He felt frightened at first, for the wind ****** ******** over the empty fields: and he was cold and ******, and more alone than he had ever felt before.  Being very ***** with his walk, however, he soon fell ****** and ****** his ********. 

He felt cold and *****, when he got up next morning, and so ****** that he was ******* to ******** the ***** for a small ****, in the very first ******* through which he passed.  He had walked no more than ****** miles, when night closed in again. His feet were ****, and his legs so weak that they ******** beneath him.  Another night passed in the ***** **** air, made him worse; when he set forward on his ******* next morning he could hardly ***** along. 

He ****** at the ****** of a ***** hill till a *****-***** came up, and then ****** of the outside **********; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to **** till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a *********.  Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was ****** to do it, by reason of his ******* and **** feet.  When the ******** saw this, they put their ********* back into their pockets again, ********* that he was an **** young dog, and didn't ******* anything; and the coach ******* away and left only a ***** of **** 



In some ********, large ******* ****** were fixed up: ******* all ******* who ****** within the ********, that they would be sent to ****.  This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those ******** with all possible **********.  In others, he would stand about the ***-*****, and look ********** at every one who passed: a ********** which ********* ********** in the ********'* ******** one of the ****-**** who were ******** about, to ***** that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to ***** something.  If he ****** at a ******'* house, ten to one but they ********** to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they ****** about the ******--***** brought Oliver's heart into his *****,--**** often the only thing he had there, for many hours together. 

In fact, if it had not been for a ****-******* ********-***, and a ********** old lady, Oliver's ******** would have been ********* by the very same ******* which had put an end to his ******'*; in other words, he would most ********* have ****** dead upon the ****'* *******.  But the ********-*** gave him a **** of bread and ******; and the old lady, who had a *********** ******** ********* ******** in some ******* part of the earth, took pity upon the poor ******, and gave him what little she could ******--*** ****--**** such kind and gentle words, and such tears of ******** and **********, that they **** ****** into Oliver's soul, than all the ********** he had ever *********. 

Early on the ******* morning after he had left his ****** place, Oliver ****** slowly into the little town of ******. The ******-******** were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.  The *** was rising in all its ******** ******; but the light only ****** to show the boy his own ************ and **********, as he sat, with ******** feet and covered with ****, upon a ****-****. 

By *******, the ******** were opened; the ******-****** were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped to **** at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to ***** at him as they hurried by; but none ******** him, or ******** themselves to ******* how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat. 

He had been ********* on the step for some time: ********* at the great number of ******-****** (every other house in ****** was a ******, large or small), ****** ********** at the ******* as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ****, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of ******* and ************* beyond his years to **********: when he was roused by ********* that a boy, who had passed him ********** some minutes before, had returned, and was now ********* him most ********* from the opposite side of the way.  He took little **** of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close *********** so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his ****** look.  Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said, 

'*****, my *****!  What's the ***?' 

The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young ********, was about his own age: but one of the ******** looking boys that Oliver had even seen.  He was a ****-*****, ****-******, ******-***** boy enough; and as dirty a ******** as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the **** and ******* of a man.  He was short of his age: with rather ***-****, and little, sharp, **** eyes.  His hat was ***** on the top of his head so *******, that it ********** to **** off every ******--*** would have done so, very often, if the ****** had not had a ***** of every now and then giving his head a sudden ******, which brought it back to its old place again.  He **** a man's coat, which reached nearly to his *****.  He had turned the ***** back, ****-*** up his arm, to get his hands out of the *******: apparently with the ******** view of ********* them into the pockets of his ******** ********; for there he kept them.  He was, **********, as ********** and ********** a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the ********. 

'*****, my *****!  What's the ***?' said this strange young gentleman to Oliver. 

'I am very ****** and *****,' replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. 'I have walked a long way.  I have been walking these ***** days.' 

'Walking for ***** days!' said the young gentleman.  'Oh, I see. ****'* order, eh?  But,' he added, ******** Oliver's look of surprise, 'I suppose you don't know what a **** is, my ***** com-pan-i-on.' 

Oliver ****** replied, that he had always heard a ****'* mouth ********* by the **** in question. 

'My eyes, how green!' exclaimed the young gentleman. 'Why, a ****'* a ******'****; and when you walk by a ****'* order, it's not straight ******, but always ****** up, and ***** a coming down ****.  Was you never on the ****?' 

'What ****?' inquired Oliver. 

'What ****!  Why, _the_ ****--*** **** as ***** up so little room that **'** work inside a Stone ***; and always **** better when the ****'* low with people, than when it's high; **** then they can't get *******. But come,' said the young gentleman; 'you want ****, and you shall have it.  I'm at ***-*****-**** ******--**** one *** and a ******; but, as far as it ****, I'll **** out and *****.  Up with you on your ****. There!  Now then! '*******!' 

********* Oliver to ****, the young gentleman took him to an ******** ********'* shop, where he ********* a *********** of *****-******* *** and a ****-******** ****, or, as he himself ********* it, 'a ********* ****!' the *** being kept ***** and ********* from ****, by the ********* ********* of making a **** in the **** by ******* out a ******* of the *****, and ******** it *******.  Taking the bread under his arm, the young ******** turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a ***-**** in the **** of the ********. Here, a *** of **** was brought in, by direction of the ********** *****; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend's *******, made a long and ****** ****, during the ******** of which the strange boy **** him from time to time with great attention. 

'Going to London?' said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length 







'Got any ********?' 













The strange boy ********; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the *** ****-******* would let them go. 

'Do you live in London?' inquired Oliver. 

'Yes. I do, when I'm at home,' replied the boy. 'I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?' 

'I do, indeed,' answered Oliver. 'I have not ***** under a **** since I left the country.' 

'Don't **** your ******* on that *****,' said the young gentleman. 'I've got to be in London to-night; and I know a '********* old gentleman as ***** there, ***'** give you ******** for *******, and never ask for the ******--**** is, if any ******** he knows ********** you. And don't he know me?  Oh, no! Not in the least!  By no means. Certainly not!' 

The young gentleman smiled, as if to ******** that the latter ********* of ********* were ********* ********; and ******** the **** as he did 



This ********** ***** of ******* was too ******** to be ********; ********** as it was immediately followed up, by the ********* that the old gentleman ******** to, would ********* ******* Oliver with a *********** place, without loss of time.  This led to a more ******** and ************ ********; from which Oliver ********** that his friend's name was **** Dawkins, and that he was a ******** *** and ******* of the ******* gentleman before *********. 

Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a **** deal in ****** of the ******** which his ******'* interest ******** for those whom he took under his **********; but, as he had a rather ******** and ********* **** of **********, and *********** ****** that among his ******** friends he was better known by the ********* of 'The Artful Dodger,' Oliver ********* that, being of a ********** and ******** turn, the ***** ******** of his ********** had ******** been ****** away upon him.  Under this **********, he ******** resolved to ********* the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger ************, as he more than half ********* he should, to ******* the honour of his ******* ************. 

As **** Dawkins ******** to their ******** London before *********, it was nearly ****** o'clock when they reached the ******** at *********. They crossed from the ***** into **. ****'* Road; struck down the small street which ********** at ******'* ***** *******; through ******* Street and ******* ***; down the little ***** by the side of the workhouse; across the ******* ground which once **** the name of *******-**-***-****; ****** into Little ******* Hill; and so into ******* Hill the Great: along which the Dodger ******* at a ***** pace, ********* Oliver to follow close at his *****. 

Although Oliver had enough to ****** his attention in ******* sight of his ******, he could not help ********* a few ***** ******* on either side of the way, as he passed along.  A ******* or more wretched place he had never seen.  The street was very narrow and *****, and the air was *********** with ****** ******. 

There were a good many small *****; but the only ***** in trade appeared to be ***** of children, who, even at that time of night, were ******** in and out at the *****, or ********* from the inside.  The **** ****** that seemed to ******* **** the ******* ****** of the place, were the ******-******; and in them, the ****** ****** of ***** were ********* with might and ****. Covered **** and *****, which here and there ******** from the **** street, ********* little ***** of houses, where ******* men and women were ********** ********* in *****; and from several of the ****-****, great ***-******* ******* were ********** ********, *****, to all appearance, on no very ****-******** or ******** *******. 

Oliver was just *********** whether he ****'* better run away, when they reached the ****** of the hill.  His *********, catching him by the arm, ****** open the door of a house near ***** ****; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them. 

'Now, then!' cried a voice from below, in reply to a ******* from the 



'****** and ****!' was the reply. 

This seemed to be some ********* or ****** that all was right; for the light of a ****** candle ******* on the wall at the ****** end of the passage; and a man's face ****** out, from where a ********** of the old kitchen ********* had been broken away. 

'There's two on you,' said the man, ********* the candle ******* out, and ********* his eyes with his hand.  '***'* the *'***** one?' 

'A new ***,' replied **** Dawkins, ******* Oliver forward. 

'Where did he come from?' 

'*********. Is Fagin upstairs?' 

'Yes, he's a ******' the *****.  Up with you!'  The candle was drawn back, and the face ***********. 

Oliver, ******* his way with one hand, and having the other firmly ******* by his companion, ******** with much ********** the dark and broken stairs: which his ********* ******* with an **** and ********** that showed he was well ********** with them. 

He threw open the door of a ****-****, and drew Oliver in after him. 

The walls and ******* of the room were perfectly black with age and ****.  There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, ***** in a ******-**** ******, two or three ****** ****, a **** and ******, and a *****.  In a ******-***, which was on the fire, and which was ******* to the *********** by a ******, some ******** were *******; and standing over them, with a ********-**** in his hand, was a very old ********** Jew, whose **********-******* and ********* face was ******** by a ******** of ****** red hair. He was ******* in a ****** ******* ****, with his throat ****; and seemed to be ******** his attention between the ******-*** and the *******-*****, over which a great number of **** ************* were *******.  Several ***** **** made of old *****, were ******* side by side on the floor. Seated round the table were four or five boys, none ***** than the Dodger, ******* long **** *****, and ******** spirits with the air of ******-**** men. These all crowded about their ********* as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and ******* at Oliver.  So did the Jew himself, ********-**** in hand. 

'This is him, Fagin,' said **** *******;'** friend Oliver Twist.' 

The Jew *******; and, making a low ********* to Oliver, took him by the hand, and ***** he should have the honour of his ******** ************. Upon this, the young gentleman with the ***** came round him, and shook both his hands very ****--********** the one in which he held his little ******.  One young gentleman was very anxious to **** up his *** for him; and another was so ******** as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very *****, he might not have the trouble of ******** them, himself, when he went to bed.  These ********** would ******** be ******** much *******, but for a ******* ******** of the Jew's ********-**** on the heads and shoulders of the ************ ****** who ******* them. 

'We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,' said the Jew. 'Dodger, take off the ********; and **** a *** near the fire for Oliver.  Ah, you're *-******* at the ******-*************! eh, my dear. There are a good many of 'em, ain't there? **'** just looked 'em out, ready for the ****; that's all, Oliver; that's all. Ha! ha! ha!' 

The latter part of this ******, was ****** by a ********** ***** from all the ******* ****** of the merry old gentleman. In the ***** of which they went to ******. 

Oliver *** his *****, and the Jew then ***** him a glass of *** ***-***-*****: ******* him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the *******. Oliver did as he was *******. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently ****** on to one of the *****; and then he **** into a deep sleep. 





CHAPTER ** 

********** FURTHER *********** ********** THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS ******* ****** 

It was late next morning when Oliver *****, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was ******* some ****** in a ******** for *********, and ********* softly to himself as he ******* it round and round, with an iron *****. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had ********* himself, he would go on ********* and ******** again, as before. 

Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not ********** *****. There is a ****** state, between ******** and ******, when you ***** more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half ********* of everything that is passing ****** you, than you would in five ****** with your eyes fast closed, and your ****** ***** in ******* ***************. At such time, a ****** knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some ********** ********** of its ****** ******, its ******** from earth and ******** time and space, when ***** from the ********* of its ********* *********. 

Oliver was ********* in this condition. He saw the Jew with his ****-****** eyes; heard his low *********; and ********** the sound of the ***** ******* against the ********'* *****: and yet the ****-**** ****** were ******** *******, at the same time, in **** action with almost ********* he had ever known. 

When the ****** was done, the Jew drew the ******** to the ***. Standing, then in an ********** attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to ****** himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all *********** ******. 

After ********** himself upon this head, the Jew ******* gently to the door: which he ********. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some **** in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes ********* as he raised the ***, and looked in. ******** an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a *********** gold watch, ********* with ******. 

'***!' said the Jew, ********* up his shoulders, and ********** every ******* with a ******* grin. '****** dogs! ****** dogs! ******* to the last! Never told the old ****** where they were. Never ******* upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn't have ******** the ****, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine *******! Fine *******!' 

With these, and other muttered *********** of the like nature, the Jew once more ********* the watch in its place of ******. At least half a ***** more were ********* drawn forth from the same box, and ******** with ***** pleasure; besides *****, ********, *********, and other ******** of *********, of such *********** *********, and ****** ***********, that Oliver had no ****, even of their *****. 

Having ******** these ********, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the **** of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute *********** on it; for the Jew laid it **** upon the table, and ******* it with his hand, ***** over it, long and *********. At length he put it down, as if ********** of *******; and, ******* back in his chair, 



'What a fine thing ******* ********** is! Dead men never ******; dead men never bring ******* ******* to light. Ah, it's a fine thing for the trade! Five of 'em ****** up in a ***, and none left to **** *****, or turn *****-*******!' 

As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been ******* ******** before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were fixed on his in **** **********; and although the *********** was only for an *******--*** the ******** space of time that can ******** be *********--** was enough to show the old man that he had been observed. 

He closed the *** of the box with a loud *****; and, laying his hand on a bread ***** which was on the table, started ********* up. He ******** very much though; for, even in his ******, Oliver could see that the ***** ******** in the air. 

'What's that?' said the Jew. 'What do you watch me for? Why are you *****? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! *****--*****! for your life. 

'I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,' replied Oliver, ******. 'I am very ***** if I have ********* you, sir.' 

'You were not ***** an hour ago?' said the Jew, ******** ******** on the boy. 

'No! No, indeed!' replied Oliver. 

'Are you sure?' cried the Jew: with a still ******* look than before: and a *********** attitude. 

'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, *********. 'I was not, indeed, sir.' 

'****, ****, my dear!' said the Jew, ******** ******** his old manner, and ******* with the ***** a little, before he laid it down; as if to ****** the ****** that he had caught it up, in mere *****. 'Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried to ******** you. You're a ***** boy. Ha! ha! you're a ***** boy, Oliver.' The Jew ****** his hands with a *******, but ******* ******** at the box, ***************. 

'Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?' said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short *****. 

'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'Ah!' said the Jew, turning rather pale. '****--****'** mine, Oliver; my little ********. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The ***** call me a *****, my dear. Only a *****; that's all.' 

Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a ******* ***** to live in such a dirty place, with so many *******; but, thinking that perhaps his ******** for the Dodger and the other boys, **** him a good deal of money, he only cast a *********** look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up. 

'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' replied the old gentleman. '****. There's a ******* of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I'll give you a ***** to **** in, my dear.' 

Oliver got up; walked across the room; and ******* for an instant to ***** the *******.  When he turned his head, the box was gone. 

He had scarcely ****** himself, and made everything ****, by ******** the ***** out of the window, ********* to the Jew's **********, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very ********* young friend, whom Oliver had seen ******* on the previous night, and who was now ******** ********** to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to *********, on the ******, and some *** ***** and *** which the Dodger had brought home in the ***** of his hat. 

'Well,' said the Jew, glancing ***** at Oliver, and ********** himself to the Dodger, 'I hope you've been at work this morning, my *****?' 

'Hard,' replied the Dodger. 

'As *****,' added Charley Bates. 

'Good boys, good boys!' said the Jew. 'What have you got, Dodger?' 

'A couple of ******-*****,' replied that young ********. 

'*****?' inquired the Jew, with *********. 

'Pretty well,' replied the Dodger, ********* two ******-*****; one green, and the other red. 

'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the ******* carefully; 'but very **** and ****** made.  ********* *******, ain't he, Oliver?' 

'Very indeed, sir,' said Oliver. At which Mr. ******* Bates laughed ************; very much to the ********* of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed. 

'And what have you got, my dear?' said Fagin to Charley Bates. 

'*****,' replied Master Bates; at the same time ********* four 



'Well,' said the Jew, ********** them *******; 'they're very good ****, very. You haven't ****** them well, though, Charley; so the ***** shall be ****** out with a ******, and we'll ***** Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!' 

'If you please, sir,' said Oliver. 

'***'* like to be able to make ******-************* as **** as Charley Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?' said the Jew. 

'Very much, indeed, if you'll ***** me, sir,' replied Oliver. 

Master Bates saw something so *********** ********* in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, ******* the ****** he was ********, and ******** it down some wrong *******, very nearly ********** in his ********* ***********. 

'He is so ***** green!' said Charley when he *********, as an ******* to the company for his ******** *********. 

The Dodger said nothing, but he ******** Oliver's hair over his eyes, and said he'd know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, ********* Oliver's ****** ********, changed the subject by ****** whether there had been much of a crowd at the ********* that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for it was ***** from the ******* of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver ********* ******** how they could ******** have found time to be so very 



When the ********* was ******* away; the merry old ******** and the two boys ****** at a very ******* and ******** game, which was ********* in this way. The merry old gentleman, ******* a *****-*** in one pocket of his ********, a ****-**** in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a *****-***** round his neck, and ******** a **** ******* *** in his *****: ******** his coat ***** round him, and putting his *********-**** and handkerchief in his pockets, ******* up and down the room with a stick, in ********* of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day.  Sometimes he stopped at the ****-*****, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was ******* with all his might into ****-*******.  At such times, he would look ********** round him, for fear of *******, and would keep ******** all his pockets in turn, to see that he ****'* lost anything, in such a very ***** and ******* manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.  All this time, the two boys followed him ******* about: ******* out of his sight, so ******, every time he turned round, that it was ********** to follow their *******. At last, the Dodger **** upon his ****, or ran upon his **** **********, while Charley Bates ******** up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most ************* ********, *****-***, ****-****, *****-*****, *****, *****-***, ******-************, even the *********-****.  If the old ******** felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over 



When this game had been ****** a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was ***** ***, and the other Nancy.  They **** a good deal of hair, not very ****** turned up behind, and were rather ****** about the ***** and *********. They were not ******* pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of ****** in their faces, and looked quite ***** and ******.  Being ********** free and ********* in their *******, Oliver thought them very **** ***** indeed.  As there is no doubt they were. 

The ******** stopped a long time. Spirits were ********, in *********** of one of the young ladies *********** of a ******** in her inside; and the conversation took a very ********* and ********* turn. At length, Charley Bates ********* his opinion that it was time to *** the ****. This, it ******** to Oliver, must be ****** for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been ****** ********* by the ******* old Jew with money to *****. 

'There, my dear,' said Fagin. 'That's a pleasant life, isn't it? They have gone out for the day.' 

'Have they done work, sir?' inquired Oliver. 

'Yes,' said the Jew; 'that is, unless they should ************ come across any, when they are out; and they won't ******* it, if they do, my dear, ****** upon it.  Make 'em your ******, my dear. Make 'em your ******,' ******* the ****-****** on the ****** to *** force to his words; 'do everything they *** you, and take their ****** in all *******--********** the ******'*, my dear. He'll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take ******* by ***.--** my handkerchief ******* out of my pocket, my dear?' said the Jew, stopping 



'Yes, sir,' said Oliver. 

'See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at **** this morning.' 

Oliver held up the ****** of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief ******* out of it with the other. 

'Is it gone?' cried the Jew. 

'Here it is, sir,' said Oliver, ******* it in his hand. 

'You're a ****** boy, my dear,' said the ******* old gentleman, ******* Oliver on the head ***********. 'I never saw a ******* lad. Here's a ******** for you. If you go on, in this way, you'll be the ******** man of the time. And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the ***** out of the *************.' 

Oliver ******** what ******* the old gentleman's pocket in ****, had to do with his ******* of being a great man.  But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his ******, must know best, he followed him ******* to the table, and was soon ****** ******** in his new *****. 





CHAPTER * 

OLIVER ******* BETTER ********** WITH THE ********** OF HIS NEW **********; AND ********* ********** AT A HIGH *****. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY ********* CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY 

For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, ******* the ***** out of the ******-************, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already *********: which the two boys and the Jew ******, *********, every morning. At length, he began to ******** for fresh air, and took many ********* of ********* ********** the old gentleman to ***** him to go out to work with his two companions. 

Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be ******** ********, by what he had seen of the ***** ******** of the old gentleman's *********. ******** the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, *****-******, he would ********* with great ********* on the misery of **** and **** ******; and would ******* upon them the ********* of an ****** life, by ******* them ********** to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to ***** them both down a ****** of stairs; but this was ******** out his ******** ******** to an ******* ******. 

At length, one morning, Oliver ******** the ********** he had so eagerly ******. There had been no ************* to work upon, for two or three days, and the ******* had been rather ******. Perhaps these were ******* for the old gentleman's giving his ******; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the ***** ************ of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger. 

The three boys ******* out; the Dodger with his ****-******* ****** up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates ********** along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, ********* where they were going, and what ****** of *********** he would be ********** in, 



The pace at which they went, was such a very ****, ***-******* *******, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to ******* the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a ******* **********, too, of ******* the **** from the heads of small boys and ******* them down *****; while Charley Bates ********* some very ***** ******* ********** the ****** of ********, by ********* ****** ****** and ****** from the ****** at the ****** *****, and ********* them into pockets which were so ************ *********, that they seemed to ********* his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of ********* his ********* of ******* his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly ******** into another *******, by a very ********** change of ********* on the part of the Dodger. 

They were just ******** from a narrow ***** not far from the open ****** in ***********, which is yet called, by some strange ********** of *****, 'The Green': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his ****** on his ***, drew his companions back again, with the ******** ******* and **************. 

'What's the matter?' demanded Oliver. 

'Hush!' replied the Dodger. 'Do you see that old **** at the 



'The old gentleman over the way?' said Oliver. 'Yes, I see him.' 

'He'll do,' said the Dodger. 

'A ***** *****,' observed Master Charley Bates. 

Oliver looked from one to the other, with the ******** surprise; but he was not ********* to make any *********; for the two boys walked ********** across the road, and ***** close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been ********. Oliver walked a few ***** after them; and, not knowing whether to ******* or ******, stood looking on in silent *********. 

The old gentleman was a very ***********-******* *********, with a ******** head and gold **********. He was ******* in a ******-***** coat with a black ****** ******; **** white ********; and carried a ***** ****** cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the *****, and there he stood, ******* away, as hard as if he were in his *****-*****, in his own *****. It is very possible that he ******* himself there, indeed; for it was *****, from his ***********, that he saw not the ****-*****, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was ******* straight through: turning over the **** when he got to the ****** of a ****, ********* at the top **** of the next one, and going ********* on, with the ******** interest and *********. 

What was Oliver's ****** and alarm as he stood a few ***** off, looking on with his ******* as **** open as they would ******** go, to see the Dodger ****** his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and **** from ****** a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and ******* to ****** them, both running away round the corner at full 



In an instant the whole ******* of the ************, and the *******, and the ******, and the Jew, ****** upon the boy's mind. 

He stood, for a moment, with the blood so ******** through all his ***** from ******, that he felt as if he were in a ******* fire; then, ******** and frightened, he took to his *****; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground. 

This was all done in a minute's space. In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and ******* his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy ******** away at such a ***** pace, he very ********* ********* him to be the **********; and ******** 'Stop thief!' with all his might, made off after him, book in hand. 

But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the ***-***-***. The Dodger and Master Bates, ********* to ******* public attention by running down the open street, had merely ******* into the very first ******* round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, ******** ******* how the matter stood, they ****** forth with great ***********; and, ******** 'Stop thief!' too, ****** in the ******* like good ********. 

Although Oliver had been brought up by ************, he was not ************* ********** with the beautiful ***** that ****-************ is the first *** of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been ******** for this. Not being ********, however, it ******* him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys ******* and ******** behind him. 

'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a ***** in the sound. The ********* ****** his *******, and the ***-*** his ******; the ******* ****** down his ****; the ***** his ******; the ******* his ****; the ******-*** his *******; the ******-*** his *******; the ******* his *******; the child his **********. Away they run, ****-****, ******-*******, ****-****: *******, *******, *********, ******** down the ********** as they turn the *******, ******* up the dogs, and *********** the *****: and streets, *******, and ******, **-**** with the sound. 

'Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry is taken up by a ******* ******, and the crowd ********** at every turning. Away they ***, ********* through the ***, and ******** along the *********: up go the windows, out run the people, ****** bear the ***, a whole ******** ****** ***** in the very ******** of the ****, and, ******* the ******* ******, ***** the *****, and **** fresh ****** to the cry, 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' 

'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a passion FOR _*******_ _something_ ****** ********* in the ***** breast.  One wretched ********** child, ******* with **********; ****** in his looks; ***** in his eyes; large ***** of ************ ********* down his face; ******* every ***** to make head upon his ********; and as they follow on his *****, and **** upon him every instant, they **** his ********** strength with joy. 'Stop thief!'  **, stop him for ***'* sake, were it only in mercy! 

Stopped at last!  A ****** blow.  He is down upon the ********; and the crowd eagerly ****** round him:  each new *****, ******** and ********** with the others to ***** a *******.  'Stand *****!'  'Give him a little air!'  '********! he don't ******* it.'  '*****'* the gentleman?'  'Here his is, coming down the street.'  'Make room there for the gentleman!' 'Is this the boy, sir!'  'Yes.' 

Oliver lay, covered with *** and ****, and ******** from the mouth, looking ****** round upon the **** of faces that ********** him, when the old gentleman was *********** ******* and ****** into the ****** by the ******** of the ********. 

'Yes,' said the gentleman, 'I am afraid it is the boy.' 

'Afraid!' ******** the crowd.  'That's a good '**!' 

'Poor fellow!' said the gentleman, 'he has **** himself.' 

'_I_ did that, sir,' said a great ******** fellow, ******** forward; 'and ********** I cut my ******* ****' his mouth.  I stopped him, sir.' 

The fellow ******* his hat with a grin, ********* something for his *****; but, the old gentleman, ****** him with an expression of *******, look ********* round, as if he ************ running away himself:  which it is very possible he might have ********* to do, and thus have ******** another *****, had not a ****** officer (who is ********* the last person to ****** in such *****) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and ****** Oliver by the ******. 

'Come, get up,' said the man, *******. 

'It wasn't me indeed, sir.  Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,' said Oliver, ******** his hands ************, and looking round.  'They are here *********.' 

'Oh no, they ain't,' said the officer.  He ***** this to be ********, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had ***** off down the first ********** ***** they came to. 

'Come, get up!' 

'Don't **** him,' said the old gentleman, ***************. 

'Oh no, I won't **** him,' replied the officer, ******* his ****** half off his back, in proof *******.  'Come, I know you; it won't do.  Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?' 

Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a ***** to ***** himself on his feet, and was at once ****** along the streets by the ******-******, at a ***** pace.  The gentleman walked on with them by the *******'* side; and as many of the crowd as could ******* the ****, got a little *****, and ****** back at Oliver from time to time.  The boys ******* in *******; and on they went. 





CHAPTER ** 

****** OF MR. FANG THE ****** MAGISTRATE; AND ********* A SLIGHT ******** OF HIS **** OF ************* JUSTICE 

The ******* had been ********* within the ********, and indeed in the ********* ************ of, a very ********* ************ ****** office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of ************ Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called ****** Hill, when he was led beneath a low *******, and up a dirty *****, into this ********** of ******* justice, by the back way.  It was a small ***** **** into which they turned; and here they *********** a ***** man with a ***** of ******** on his face, and a ***** of **** in his hand. 

'What's the matter now?' said the man **********. 

'A young *****-******,' replied the man who had Oliver in ******. 

'Are you the party that's been ******, sir?' inquired the man with the 



'Yes, I am,' replied the old gentleman; 'but I am not sure that this boy ******** took the handkerchief.  *--* would rather not ***** the 



'Must go before the magistrate now, sir,' replied the man. 'His worship will be ********** in half a minute.  Now, young *******!' 

This was an ********** for Oliver to ***** through a door which he ******** as he spoke, and which led into a stone ****.  Here he was ********; and nothing being found upon him, locked up. 

This **** was in ***** and **** something like an **** ******, only not so light.  It was most *********** dirty; for it was ****** morning; and it had been ******** by six ******* people, who had been locked up, *********, since ******** night.  But this is little.  In our *******-******, men and women are every night ******** on the most ******* *******--*** word is worth ******--** ********, ******** with which, those in *******, ******** by the most ********* ******, tried, found ******, and under ******** of death, are *******. Let any one who ****** this, ******* the two. 

The old gentleman looked almost as ****** as Oliver when the key ****** in the ****.  He turned with a **** to the book, which had been the ******** cause of all this ***********. 

'There is something in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, ******* his **** with the ***** of the book, in a ********** manner; 'something that ******* and ********* me.  _Can_ he be ********?  He looked ****--*** the ***,' exclaimed the old gentleman, ******* very ********, and ******* up into the ***, 'Bless my ****!--***** have I seen something like that look before?' 

After ****** for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same ********** face, into a back ******** opening from the ****; and there, ******** into a corner, called up before his ****'* eye a **** ************ of faces over which a ***** ******* had hung for many years.  'No,' said the old gentleman, shaking his head; 'it must be 



He ******** over them again.  He had called them into view, and it was not **** to ******* the ****** that had so long ********* them.  There were the faces of friends, and ****, and of many that had been almost ********* ******* *********** from the crowd; there were the faces of young and ******** ***** that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, ******** to its power, still ******* in their old ********* and ******, ******* back the ****** of the eyes, the ********** of the smile, the ******* of the soul through its **** of ****, and ********** of ****** beyond the ****, changed but to be **********, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to **** a **** and gentle **** upon the **** to 



But the old gentleman could ****** no one countenance of which Oliver's features **** a *****.  So, he ****** a **** over the ************* he awakened; and being, ******* for himself, an ****** old gentleman, ****** them again in the ***** of the ***** book. 

He was roused by a ***** on the shoulder, and a ******* from the man with the **** to follow him into the office.  He closed his book hastily; and was at once ******* into the ******** presence of the ******** Mr. Fang. 

The office was a front parlour, with a ******** wall.  Mr. Fang sat behind a ***, at the ***** end; and on one side the door was a sort of ****** *** in which poor little Oliver was already *********; trembling very much at the ********* of the scene. 

Mr. Fang was a ****, ****-******, *****-******, ******-***** man, with no great ******** of hair, and what he had, ******* on the back and ***** of his head.  His face was *****, and much *******.  If he were really not in the ***** of ******** rather more than was ******* good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for *****, and have ********* heavy *******. 

The old gentleman ***** ************; and ********* to the **********'* ****, said, ******* the action to the word, 'That is my name and *******, sir.'  He then ******** a pace or two; and, with another ****** and *********** *********** of the head, ****** to be **********. 

Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment ******** a ******* ******* in a ********* of the morning, ********* to some ****** ******** of his, and ********** him, for the three ******* and ******** time, to the ******* and particular notice of the ********* of State for the Home **********.  He was out of ******; and he looked up with an ***** *****. 

'Who are you?' said Mr. Fang. 

The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his ****. 

'Officer!' said Mr. Fang, ******* the **** ************** away with the *********.  'Who is this fellow?' 

'My name, sir,' said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman, 'my name, sir, is Brownlow.  ****** me to ******* the name of the magistrate who ****** a ********** and ********** ****** to a *********** person, under the ********** of the *****.'  Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked ****** the office as if in ****** of some person who would ****** him the ******** ***********. 

'Officer!' said Mr. Fang, ******** the paper on one side, 'what's this fellow ******* with?' 

'He's not ******* at all, your worship,' replied the officer. 'He ******* against this boy, your worship.' 

His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good *********, and a safe one. 

'******* against the boy, does he?' said Mr. Fang, ********* Mr. Brownlow ************** from head to foot.  '***** him!' 

'Before I am *****, I must beg to say one word,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'and that is, that I really never, without ****** **********, could have ********--' 

'Hold your ******, sir!' said Mr. Fang, ************. 

'I will not, sir!' replied the old gentleman. 

'Hold your ****** this instant, or I'll have you turned out of the office!' said Mr. Fang.  'You're an ******** *********** fellow.  How **** you ***** a magistrate!' 

'What!' exclaimed the old gentleman, *********. 

'***** this person!' said Fang to the *****.  'I'll not hear another word.  ***** him.' 

Mr. ********'* *********** was ******* roused; but ********** perhaps, that he might only ****** the boy by giving **** to it, he ********** his feelings and ********* to be ***** at once. 

'Now,' said Fang, 'what's the ****** against this boy?  What have you got to say, sir?' 

'I was standing at a *********--' Mr. Brownlow began. 

'Hold your ******, sir,' said Mr. Fang.  '*********!  *****'* the *********?  Here, ***** this *********.  Now, *********, what is this?' 

The *********, with ******** ********, ******* how he had taken the ******; how he had ******** Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it. 

'Are there any *********?' inquired Mr. Fang. 

'None, your worship,' replied the *********. 

Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the **********, said in a ******** passion. 

'Do you mean to state what your ********* against this boy is, man, or do you not?  You have been *****.  Now, if you stand there, ******** to give ********, I'll ****** you for ********** to the *****; I will, 



By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the ***** and ****** ******* very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus ********** the word from being *****--**********, of course. 

With many *************, and repeated *******, Mr. Brownlow ********* to state his case;  ********* that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and ********** his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not ******** the thief, to be ********* with the *******, he would deal as ********* with him as justice would *****. 

'He has been **** already,' said the old gentleman in **********. 'And I fear,' he added, with great ******, looking towards the ***, 'I really fear that he is ill.' 

'Oh! yes, I **** say!' said Mr. Fang, with a *****.  'Come, none of your ****** here, you young ********; they won't do. What's your name?' 

Oliver tried to reply but his ****** ****** him.  He was ****** pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round. 

'What's your name, you ******** *********?' demanded Mr. Fang. 'Officer, what's his name?' 

This was addressed to a ***** old fellow, in a ******* waistcoat, who was standing by the ***.  He **** over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really ********* of ************* the question; and knowing that his not ******** would only ********* the magistrate the more, and *** to the ******** of his ********; he ******** a *****. 

'He says his ****'* Tom White, your worship,' said the ****-******* 



'Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?' said Fang.  'Very well, very well. Where does he live?' 

'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again ********** to ******* Oliver's answer. 

'Has he any *******?' inquired Mr. Fang. 

'He says they died in his *******, your worship,' replied the officer: ********* the usual reply. 

At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with ********* eyes, ******** a ****** ****** for a ******* of 



'***** and ********!' said Mr. Fang:  'don't *** to make a **** of me.' 

'I think he really is ill, your worship,' ************ the officer. 

'I know better,' said Mr. Fang. 

'Take care of him, officer,' said the old gentleman, raising his hands *************; 'he'll **** down.' 

'Stand away, officer,' cried Fang;  'let him, if he *****.' 

Oliver ******* himself of the kind **********, and fell to the floor in a ******** fit.  The men in the office looked at each other, but no one ***** to ****. 

'I knew he was ********,' said Fang, as if this were ************* proof of the fact.  'Let him lie there; he'll soon be ***** of that.' 

'How do you ******* to deal with the case, sir?'  inquired the ***** in a low voice. 

'*********,' replied Mr. Fang.  'He ****** ********* for three ******--**** ****** of course.  Clear the office.' 

The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were ********* to carry the ********** boy to his ****; when an ******* man of ****** but poor appearance, **** in an old suit of black, ****** hastily into the office, and ******** towards the *****. 

'Stop, stop!  don't take him away!  For ******'* sake stop a moment!' cried the new *****, ********** with *****. 

Although the ********* ***** in such an office as this, ******** a ******* and ********* power over the *********, the good name, the *********, almost the *****, of Her *******'* ********, ********** of the ****** *****; and although, within such walls, enough ********* ****** are ***** ****** to make the ****** ***** with *******; they are closed to the public, save through the ****** of the ***** *****.[********:  Or were *********, then.] Mr. Fang was ************ not a little ********* to see an ******** ***** ***** in such ********** ********. 

'What is this?  Who is this?  Turn this man out.  Clear the office!' cried Mr. Fang. 

'I _will_ speak,' cried the man; 'I will not be turned out.  I saw it all.  I keep the ****-*****.  I ****** to be *****. I will not be put down.  Mr. Fang, you must hear me.  You must not ******, sir.' 

The man was right.  His manner was determined; and the matter was ******* rather too ******* to be ****** up. 

'***** the man,' growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill *****. 'Now, man, what have you got to say?' 

'This,' said the man:  'I saw three boys:  two others and the ******** here:  ********* on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was *******.  The robbery was ********* by another boy.  I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly ****** and ********* by it.' Having by this time ********* a little breath, the worthy ****-***** ****** proceeded to ******, in a more ******** manner the ***** circumstances of the robbery. 

'Why didn't you come here before?' said Fang, after a *****. 

'I ****'* a soul to mind the shop,' replied the man.  '********* who could have ****** me, had ****** in the *******.  I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way.' 

'The ********** was *******, was he?' inquired Fang, after another 



'Yes,' replied the man.  'The very book he has in his hand.' 

'Oh, that book, eh?' said Fang.  'Is it **** for?' 

'No, it is not,' replied the man, with a smile. 

'Dear me, I ****** all about it!' exclaimed the ****** old gentleman, 



'A **** person to ****** a ****** against a poor boy!' said Fang, with a ******* effort to look ******.  'I ********, sir, that you have ******** ********** of that book, under very ********** and ************ circumstances; and you may think yourself very ********* that the ***** of the ******** ******** to *********. Let this be a ****** to you, my man, or the *** will ******** you yet.  The boy is **********.  Clear the office!' 

'*--* me!' cried the old gentleman, ******** out with the **** he had kept down so long, '*--* me!   I'll--' 

'Clear the office!' said the magistrate.  '********, do you hear? Clear the office!' 

The ******* was ******; and the ********* Mr. Brownlow was ******** out, with the book in one hand, and the ****** cane in the other:  in a ******* ******* of **** and ********.  He reached the ****; and his passion ******** in a moment.  Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the ********, with his ***** **********, and his ******* ****** with water; his face a ****** white; and a cold ******* ********** his whole 



'Poor boy, poor boy!' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* over him. 'Call a coach, somebody, pray.  Directly!' 

A coach was ********, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other. 

'May I ********* you?' said the ****-***** ******, looking in. 

'Bless me, yes, my dear sir,' said Mr. Brownlow quickly.  'I ****** you.  Dear, dear!  I have this ******* book still! **** in.  Poor fellow!  There's no time to lose.' 

The ****-***** ****** got into the coach; and away they *****. 





CHAPTER *** 

IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE ********* ******* TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS ******** 



The coach ******* away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had ********* when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the ***** at *********, stopped at length before a **** house, in a quiet ***** street near ***********.  Here, a bed was ********, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young ****** carefully and *********** *********; and here, he was ****** with a ******** and ********** that knew no ******. 

But, for many days, Oliver remained ********** to all the goodness of his new friends.  The *** rose and ****, and rose and **** again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay ********* on his ****** bed, ********* away beneath the *** and ******* **** of fever.  The **** does not work more ****** on the dead body, than does this **** ******** fire upon the living *****. 

Weak, and ****, and ******, he ***** at last from what seemed to have been a long and ******** *****.  ****** raising himself in the bed, with his head ******* on his trembling arm, he looked ********* ******. 

'What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?' said Oliver. 'This is not the place I went to sleep in.' 

He uttered these words in a ****** voice, being very ***** and weak; but they were ********* at once.  The ******* at the ***'* head was hastily drawn back, and a ******** old lady, very ****** and ********* *******, rose as she ****** it, from an ***-***** close by, in which she had been sitting at ******-****. 

'Hush, my dear,' said the old lady softly.  'You must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very ***,--** bad as bad could be, pretty ****.  Lie down again; there's a dear!'  With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the ******; and, ********* back his hair from his ********, looked so ****** and ****** in his face, that he could not help ******* his little ******** hand in ****, and drawing it round his neck. 

'Save us!' said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  'What a ******** little dear it is.  Pretty *******!  What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!' 

'Perhaps she does see me,' whispered Oliver, ******* his hands together; 'perhaps she has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she had.' 

'That was the fever, my dear,' said the old lady ******. 

'I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the ******* of a poor boy.  But if she knew I was ill, she must have ****** me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died.  She can't know anything about me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence.  'If she had seen me ****, it would have made her *********; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have ******* of her.' 

The old lady made no reply to this; but ****** her eyes first, and her **********, which lay on the ***********, afterwards, as if they were part and ****** of those features, brought some **** ***** for Oliver to drink; and then, ******* him on the *****, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again. 

So, Oliver kept very still; ****** because he was anxious to **** the kind old lady in all things; and ******, to tell the truth, because he was ********** ********* with what he had already said.  He soon fell into a gentle ****, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and ****-******* gold watch in his hand, who felt his *****, and said he was a great deal better. 

'You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?' said the 



'Yes, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'Yes,  I know you are,' said the gentleman:  'You're ****** too, **'* 



'No, sir,' answered Oliver. 

'***!' said the gentleman.  'No, I know you're not.  He is not ******, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the gentleman:  looking very ****. 

The old lady made a ********** *********** of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very ****** man. The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself. 

'You feel ******, don't you, my dear?' said the doctor. 

'No, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'No,' said the doctor, with a very ****** and ********* look. 'You're not ******.  Nor *******.  Are you?' 

'Yes, sir, rather *******,' answered Oliver. 

'Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the doctor.  'It's very ******* that he should be *******.  You may give him a little tea, ma'am, and some *** ***** without any ******.  Don't keep him too ****, ma'am; but be ******* that you don't let him be too cold; will you have the 



The old lady dropped a *******.  The doctor, after ******* the **** *****, and ********** a ********* ******** of it, hurried away:  his ***** ******** in a very ********* and ******* manner as he went 



Oliver ***** off again, soon after this; when he *****, it was nearly ****** o'clock.  The old lady ******** **** him ****-***** ******* afterwards, and left him in ****** of a *** old woman who had just come:  ******** with her, in a little ******, a small ****** Book and a large ********. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after ******* Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a ****** of short ****, ********* at ******** ********* with ****** ********* forward, and ****** ***** and ********. These, however, had no worse effect than ******* her to *** her nose very hard, and then **** ****** 



And thus the night crept slowly on.  Oliver lay ***** for some time, ******** the little ******* of light which the ********** of the *********-***** threw upon the *******; or ******* with his ******* eyes the ********* ******* of the paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep ********* of the room were very ******; as they brought into the boy's mind the thought that death had been ******** there, for many days and ******, and might yet **** it with the ***** and ***** of his ***** presence, he turned his face upon the ******, and ********* ****** to Heaven. 

Gradually, he fell into that deep ******** sleep which **** from ****** ********* alone *******; that **** and ******** rest which it is pain to **** from.  Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the ********* and ******** of life; to all its ***** for the present; its ********* for the ******; more than all, its ***** ************* of the past! 

It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt ******** and happy.  The ****** of the ******* was ****** past.  He ******** to the world again. 

In three days' time he was able to sit in an ****-*****, well ******* up with *******; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little ***********'* room, which ******** to her.  Having him set, here, by the ****-****, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of ************ ******* at seeing him so much better, ********* began to cry most 



'Never mind me, my dear,' said the old lady; 'I'm only having a ******* good cry.  There; it's all over now; and I'm quite ***********.' 

'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver. 

'Well, never you mind that, my dear,' said the old lady; 'that's got nothing to do with your *****; and it's full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he'll be *******.'  And with this, the old lady ******* herself to ******* up, in a little ********, a ***** full of *****:  strong enough, Oliver thought, to ******* an ***** ******, when ******* to the ********** strength, for three ******* and ***** paupers, at the ****** 



'Are you **** of ********, dear?' inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most ********, on a ******** which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair. 

'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the ******; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a beautiful, **** face that ****'* is!' 

'Ah!' said the old lady, '******** always make ladies out ******** than they are, or they wouldn't get any ******, child. The man that ******** the ******* for taking ********** might have known that would never *******; it's a deal too ******.  A deal,' said the old lady, ******** very ******** at her own *********. 

'**--** that a ********, ma'am?' said Oliver. 

'Yes,' said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the *****; 'that's a ********.' 

'Whose, ma'am?' asked Oliver. 

'Why, really, my dear, I don't know,' answered the old lady in a ****-******** manner.  'It's not a ******** of anybody that you or I know, I ******.  It ***** to ****** your *****, dear.' 

'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver. 

'Why, sure you're not afraid of it?' said the old lady: ********* in great surprise, the look of *** with which the child ******** the 



'Oh no, no,' returned Oliver quickly; 'but the eyes look so *********; and where I sit, they **** fixed upon me.  It ***** my heart beat,' added Oliver in a low voice, 'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn't.' 

'**** save us!' exclaimed the old lady, starting; 'don't talk in that way, child.  You're weak and ******* after your *******. Let me ***** your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it.  There!' said the old lady, ******* the action to the word; 'you don't see it now, at all ******.' 

Oliver _did_ see it in his ****'* eye as ********** as if he had not ******* his position; but he thought it better not to ***** the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, ********* that he felt more ***********, ****** and ***** **** of ******* bread into the *****, with all the ****** ********* so ****** a ***********. Oliver got through it with ************* **********.  He had scarcely ********* the last ********, when there came a **** *** at the door.  'Come in,' said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow. 

Now, the old gentleman came in as ***** as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his ********** on his ********, and thrust his hands behind the ****** of his ********-**** to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance ********* a very great ******* of *** ***********.  Oliver looked very **** and ******* from ********, and made an *********** ******* to stand up, out of ******* to his **********, which ********** in his ******* back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. ********'* heart, being large enough for any six ******** old gentlemen of ****** ***********, forced a ****** of tears into his eyes, by some ********* ******* which we are not ************ ************* to be in a condition to *******. 

'Poor boy, poor boy!' said Mr. Brownlow, ******** his throat. 'I'm rather ****** this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I'm afraid I have caught 



'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin.  'Everything you have had, has been well *****, sir.' 

'I don't know, Bedwin.  I don't know,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'I rather think I had a **** ****** at ******-**** *********; but never mind that.  How do you feel, my dear?' 

'Very happy, sir,' replied Oliver.  'And very ******** indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.' 

'Good by,' said Mr. Brownlow, *******.  'Have you given him any ***********, Bedwin?  Any *****, eh?' 

'He has just had a ***** of beautiful strong *****, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin:  drawing herself up ********, and laying strong ******** on the last word:  to ******** that between *****, and ***** will **********, there ******* no ******** or ********** **********. 

'***!' said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight *******; 'a couple of ******* of **** **** would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn't they, Tom White, eh?' 

'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little *******:  with a look of great astonishment. 

'Oliver,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'Oliver what?  Oliver White, eh?' 

'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.' 

'***** name!' said the old gentleman.  'What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?' 

'I never told him so, sir,' returned Oliver in *********. 

This ******* so like a *********, that the old gentleman looked ******** ******* in Oliver's face.  It was ********** to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its **** and ********* **********. 

'Some *******,' said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his ****** for looking ******** at Oliver no longer *******, the old **** of the *********** between his features and some ******** face came upon him so ********, that he could not ******** his ****. 

'I hope you are not ***** with me, sir?' said Oliver, raising his eyes 



'No, no,' replied the old gentleman.  'Why! what's this?  Bedwin, look 



As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the ******* over Oliver's head, and then to the boy's face.  There was its living ****. The eyes, the head, the mouth; every ******* was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so ********* *****, that the ******** **** seemed ****** with ********* ********! 

Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden ***********; for, not being strong enough to bear the ***** it gave him, he ******* away.  A ******** on his part, which ******* the ********* an opportunity of ********* the ****** from ********, in ****** of the two young ****** of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of *********-- 

That when the Dodger, and his ************ friend Master Bates, ****** in the ***-***-*** which was raised at Oliver's *****, in *********** of their ********* an ******* ********** of Mr. ********'* ******** ********, as has been already *********, they were ******** by a very ******** and ******** ****** for themselves; and ********* as the ******* of the subject and the ******* of the ********** are among the first and ******** ****** of a ****-******* **********, so, I need hardly beg the ****** to *******, that this action should **** to ***** them in the opinion of all public and ********* men, in almost as great a ****** as this strong proof of their ******* for their own ************ and ****** **** to *********** and ******* the little **** of **** which certain ******** and *****-******* ************ have laid down as the ****-******* of all ******'* ***** and *******:  the said ************ very ****** ******** the good ****'* *********** to matters of ***** and ******:  and, by a very **** and pretty ********** to her ******* ****** and *************, putting ******** out of sight any ************** of heart, or ******** ******* and feeling. For, these are matters ******* beneath a female who is ************ by ********* ********* to be far above the ******** little ******* and ********** of her ***. 

If I wanted any further proof of the ******** ************* nature of the ******* of these young gentlemen in their very ******** ***********, I should at once find it in the fact (also ******** in a ********* part of this *********), of their ******** the *******, when the ******* attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the ******** possible cut.  Although I do not mean to ****** that it is ******* the ******** of ******** and ******* *****, to ******* the road to any great ********** (their course indeed being rather to ******** the distance, by various *************** and ********** ***********, like **** those in which ******* men under the ******** of a too ****** **** of *****, are ***** to *******); still, I do mean to say, and do say **********, that it is the ********** ******** of many ****** ************, in ******** out their ********, to ****** great ****** and ********* in ********* against every possible *********** which can be supposed at all ****** to ****** themselves.  Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be ********, will *******; the ****** of the right, or the ****** of the wrong, or indeed the *********** between the two, being left ******** to the *********** *********, to be ******* and determined by his clear, *************, and ********* view of his own particular case. 

It was not until the two boys had *******, with great ********, through a most ********* **** of narrow streets and ******, that they ******** to **** beneath a low and dark *******.  Having remained silent here, just long enough to ******* breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an *********** of ********* and *******; and, ******** into an ************** fit of ********, ***** himself upon a ********, and ****** ******* in a ********* of *****. 

'What's the matter?' inquired the Dodger. 

'Ha! ha! ha!' ****** Charley Bates. 

'Hold your noise,' ************ the Dodger, looking ********** round. 'Do you want to be *******, ******?' 

'I can't help it,' said Charley, 'I can't help it!  To see him ********* away at that pace, and ******* round the *******, and ******** up again' the *****, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the **** in my pocket, ******* out ***** ***--**, my eye!' The ***** *********** of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong *******.  As he arrived at this **********, he again ****** upon the ****-****, and laughed ****** than 



'****'** Fagin say?' inquired the Dodger; taking ********* of the next ******** of ************** on the part of his friend to ******** the 



'What?' repeated Charley Bates. 

'Ah, what?' said the Dodger. 

'Why, what should he say?' inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly in his *********; for the ******'* manner was **********.  'What should he say?' 

Mr. Dawkins ******** for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, ********* his head, and nodded ******. 

'What do you mean?' said Charley. 

'**** *** *** ***, ****** and ********, the **** he wouldn't, and high **********,' said the Dodger:  with a slight ***** on his ************ 



This was ***********, but not ************.  Master Bates felt it so; and again said, 'What do you mean?' 

The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and ********* the ****** of his ****-****** coat under his arm, thrust his ****** into his *****, ******* the bridge of his nose some ****-***** times in a ******** but ********** manner, and turning on his ****, ***** down the *****.  Master Bates followed, with a ********** countenance. 

The noise of ********* on the ******** stairs, a few minutes after the ********** of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a ******* and a small **** in his hand; a ******-***** in his right; and a ****** *** on the ******.  There was a ******** smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking ******* out from under his thick red ********, **** his ear towards the door, and listened. 

'Why, ***'* this?' muttered the Jew:  ******** countenance; 'only two of 'em?  *****'* the *****?  They can't have got into trouble.  ****!' 

The ********* ********** ******; they reached the *******. The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, ******* it behind them. 





CHAPTER **** 

SOME NEW ************* ARE ********** TO THE *********** ******, ********* WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE *******, ************ TO THIS HISTORY 

'*****'* Oliver?' said the Jew, rising with a ******** look. '*****'* the boy?' 

The young ******* **** their ********* as if they were ******* at his violence; and looked ******** at each other.  But they made no reply. 

'What's become of the boy?' said the Jew, ******* the Dodger ******* by the ******, and *********** him with ****** ************.  'Speak out, or I'll ******** you!' 

Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who ****** it ******* in all ***** to be on the safe side, and who ********* it by no means ********** that it might be his turn to be ********* second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, ****-*********, and ********** ****--********* between a mad **** and a speaking *******. 

'Will you speak?' ********* the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that his ******* in the *** coat at all, seemed perfectly **********. 

'Why, the ***** have got him, and that's all about it,' said the Dodger, ********.  'Come, let go *' me, will you!'  And, ******** himself, at one ****, ***** out of the *** coat, which he left in the Jew's hands, the Dodger ******** up the ******** ****, and made a **** at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more ********* out than could have been ****** 



The Jew ******* back in this *********, with more ******* than could have been *********** in a man of his ******** ***********; and, ******* up the ***, ******** to **** it at his *********'* head.  But Charley Bates, at this moment, ******* his attention by a perfectly ******** ****, he suddenly ******* its ***********, and ***** it full at that young gentleman. 

'Why, what the ****** is in the wind now!' growled a deep voice. 'Who ******* that '*** at me?  It's well it's the ****, and not the ***, as *** me, or I'd have ******* somebody.  I might have ****'*, as nobody but an ********, ****, **********, ********** old Jew could ****** to ***** away any drink but *****--*** not that, unless he done the ***** Company every quarter.  ***'* it all about, Fagin?  *--**, if my ****-*********** **'* ***** with ****!  Come in, you ******** *******; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ******* of your master! Come in!' 

The man who growled out these words, was a *******-***** fellow of about ****-***-******, in a black ********* coat, very ****** **** ********, ****-** half *****, and **** ****** ********* which ******** a ***** pair of legs, with large ******** ******;--*** kind of legs, which in such *******, always look in an ********** and ********** state without a set of ******* to ******* them.  He had a ***** hat on his head, and a dirty ******* handkerchief round his neck:  with the long ****** **** of which he ******* the **** from his face as he spoke.  He *********, when he had done so, a ***** heavy countenance with a ***** of three days' ******, and two ******** eyes; one of which ********* various *****-******** ******** of having been ******** ******* by a blow. 

'Come in, *'** hear?' growled this ******** *******. 

A white ****** dog, with his face ********* and **** in twenty different ******, ******* into the room. 

'Why didn't you come in afore?' said the man.  'You're ******* too ***** to own me afore company, are you?  Lie down!' 

This ******* was accompanied with a ****, which sent the ****** to the other end of the room.  He appeared well used to it, however; for he ****** himself up in a corner very *******, without ******** a sound, and ******* his very ***-******* eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to ****** himself in taking a ****** of the *********. 

'What are you up to?  ***-******** the boys, you ********, **********, **-**-**-*-*** old *****?' said the man, ******* himself ************. 'I wonder they don't murder you!  I would if I was them.  If I'd been your '********, I'd have done it long ago, ***--**, I couldn't have **** you afterwards, for you're fit for nothing but ******* as a ********** of ******** in a glass ******, and I suppose they don't blow glass ******* large enough.' 

'Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,' said the Jew, trembling; 'don't speak so loud!' 

'None of your *********,' replied the *******; 'you always mean ******** when you come that.  You know my name:  out with it!  I ****'* ******** it when the time comes.' 

'Well, well, ****--**** Sikes,' said the Jew, with ****** ********. 'You **** out of ******, Bill.' 

'Perhaps I am,' replied Sikes; 'I should think you was rather out of ***** too, unless you mean as little **** when you ***** ****** **** about, as you do when you **** and--' 

'Are you mad?' said the Jew, catching the man by the ******, and pointing towards the boys. 

Mr. Sikes ********* himself with ***** an ********* **** under his left ear, and ******* his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of **** show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.  He then, in cant *****, with which his whole conversation was *********** ***********, but which would be quite ************** if they were ******** here, demanded a glass of ******. 

'And mind you don't ****** it,' said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the 



This was said in ****; but if the ******* could have seen the **** **** with which the Jew bit his pale *** as he turned round to the ********, he might have thought the ******* not ****** ***********, or the wish (at all ******) to ******* upon the *********'* ********* not very far from the old gentleman's merry heart. 

After ********** two of three ******* of spirits, Mr. Sikes ************ to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which ******** *** led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's ******* were **************** ********, with such *********** and ************ on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most ********* under the circumstances. 

'I'm afraid,' said the Jew, 'that he may say something which will get us into trouble.' 

'That's very ******,' returned Sikes with a ********* grin. 'You're ****** upon, Fagin.' 

'And I'm afraid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not ******* the ************; and ********* the other ******* as he did **,--'*'* afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.' 

The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.  But the old gentleman's shoulders were ******** up to his ears; and his eyes were ******** ******* on the opposite wall. 

There was a long *****. Every ****** of the *********** ******* appeared ******* in his own ***********; not ********* the dog, who by a certain ********* ******* of his lips seemed to be ********** an ****** upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might ********* in the streets when he went out. 

'Somebody must find out ***'* been done at the office,' said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in. 

The Jew nodded ******. 

'If he ****'* *******, and is *********, there's no fear till he comes out again,' said Mr. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken care on.  You must get hold of him *******.' 

Again the Jew nodded. 

The ******** of this **** of action, indeed, was *******; but, *************, there was one very strong ********* to its being *******.  This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. ******* Sikes, happened, one and all, to ********* a violent and ******-****** ********* to going near a ******-****** on any ground or ******* ********. 

How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of *********** not the most pleasant of its kind, it is ********* to *****.  It is not necessary to make any ******* on the subject, however; for the sudden ******** of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, ****** the conversation to **** ******. 

'The very thing!' said the Jew.  '*** will go; won't you, my dear?' 

'******?' inquired the young lady. 

'Only just up to the office, my dear,' said the Jew *********. 

It is *** to the young lady to say that she did not ********** ****** that she would not, but that she merely ********* an ******** and earnest ****** to be '*******' if she would; a ****** and ******** ******* of the *******, which ***** the young lady to have been ********* of that ******* good ******** which cannot bear to ******* upon a ******-********, the pain of a ****** and pointed *******. 

The Jew's countenance fell.  He turned from this young lady, who was *****, not to say ********** *******, in a red ****, green *****, and ****** ****-******, to the other female. 

'Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a ******** manner, 'what do YOU say?' 

'That it won't do; so it's no use *-****** it on, Fagin,' replied Nancy. 

'What do you mean by that?' said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a ***** 



'What I say, Bill,' replied the lady ***********. 

'Why, you're just the very person for it,' ******** Mr. Sikes: 'nobody about here knows anything of you.' 

'And as I don't want 'em to, neither,' replied Nancy in the same ******** manner, 'it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.' 

'***'** go, Fagin,' said Sikes. 

'No, she won't, Fagin,' said Nancy. 

'Yes, she will, Fagin,' said Sikes. 

And Mr. Sikes was right.  By **** of ********* *******, ********, and ******, the lady in question was ********** ********* upon to ********* the **********.  She was not, indeed, ******** by the same ************** as her ********* friend; for, having ******** ******* into the ************ of ***** **** from the ****** but ******* ****** of *********, she was not under the same ************ of being ********** by any of her ******** *************. 

***********, with a ***** white ***** **** over her ****, and her ****-****** ****** up under a ***** ******,--**** ******** of ***** being ******** from the Jew's ************* *****,--**** Nancy ******** to ***** forth on her ******. 

'Stop a minute, my dear,' said the Jew, *********, a little covered ******.  'Carry that in one hand.  It looks more ***********, my dear.' 

'Give her a ****-*** to carry in her *'***** one, Fagin,' said Sikes; 'it looks real and ******** like.' 

'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, ******* a large ******-**** key on the ********** of the young ****'* right hand. 

'There; very good!  Very good indeed, my dear!' said the Jew, ******* his hands. 

'Oh, my *******!  My poor, dear, sweet, ******** little *******!' exclaimed Nancy, ******** into tears, and ******** the little ****** and the ******-**** key in an ***** of ********.  'What has become of him!  Where have they taken him to!  Oh, do have pity, and tell me what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!' 

Having uttered those words in a most ********** and *****-****** tone: to the ************ ******* of her *******:  Miss Nancy paused, ****** to the company, nodded ********* round, and ***********. 

'Ah, she's a ****** girl, my *****,' said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head *******, as if in **** ********** to them to follow the bright ******* they had just ******. 

'She's a honour to her ***,' said Mr. Sikes, ******* his glass, and ******* the table with his ******** ****.  'Here's her ******, and ******* they was all like her!' 

While these, and many other *********, were being passed on the ************ Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the ******-******; *******, *************** a little ******* ******** ********** upon walking through the streets alone and ***********, she arrived in ******* ****** ******* afterwards. 

******** by the back way, she ****** softly with the key at one of the ****-*****, and listened.  There was no sound within:  so she ******* and listened again.  Still there was no reply:  so she spoke. 

'*****, dear?' ******** Nancy in a gentle voice; '*****?' 

There was nobody inside but a ********* ******** ********, who had been taken up for ******* the *****, and who, the ******* against society having been ******* ******, had been very ******** ********* by Mr. Fang to the House of ********** for one *****; with the *********** and ******* remark that since he had so much breath to *****, it would be more *********** ******** on the ********* than in a ******* **********.  He made no answer: being ******** ******** ********* the loss of the *****, which had been *********** for the use of the ******:  so Nancy passed on to the next ****, and ******* there. 

'Well!' cried a ***** and ****** voice. 

'Is there a little boy here?' inquired Nancy, with a *********** ***. 

'No,' replied the voice; 'God ******.' 

This was a ******* of *****-****, who was going to ****** for _not_ ******* the *****; or, in other words, for ******* in the streets, and doing nothing for his **********.  In the next **** was another man, who was going to the same ****** for ******* *** ********* without *******; ******* doing something for his living, in ******** of the 



But, as neither of these ********* answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the ***** officer in the ******* waistcoat; and with the most ******* ******** and ************, rendered more ******* by a ****** and ********* use of the ******-**** key and the little ******, demanded her own dear 



'I haven't got him, my dear,' said the old man. 

'Where is he?' ******** Nancy, in a ********** manner. 

'Why, the gentleman's got him,' replied the officer. 

'What gentleman!  Oh, ******** *******!  What gentleman?' exclaimed 



In reply to this ********** ***********, the old man ******** the ****** ******** ****** that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and ********** in *********** of a ******* having ****** the robbery to have been ********* by another boy, not in *******; and that the ********** had carried him away, in an ********** condition, to his own *********:  of and ********** which, all the ********* knew was, that it was ********* in ***********, he having heard that word ********* in the ********** to the ********. 

In a dreadful state of doubt and ***********, the ******** young woman ********* to the gate, and then, ********** her ********* walk for a ***** run, returned by the most ******* and *********** ***** she could think of, to the ******** of the Jew. 

Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the ********** *********, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, ************* ********:  without ******** any time to the ********* of ******* the company ****-*******. 

'We must know where he is, my *****; he must be found,' said the Jew ******* *******.  'Charley, do nothing but ***** about, till you bring home some **** of him!  Nancy, my dear, I must have him found.  I ***** to you, my ****,--** you and the Artful for everything!  ****, ****,' added the Jew, ********* a ****** with a shaking hand; 'there's money, my *****.  I shall shut up this shop to-night.  You'll know where to find me!  Don't stop here a minute.  Not an instant, my *****!' 

With these words, he ****** them from the room:  and carefully ******-******* and ******* the door behind them, drew from its place of *********** the box which he had *************** ********* to Oliver. Then, he hastily proceeded to ******* the ******* and ********* beneath his ********. 

A *** at the door ******** him in this **********.  '***'* there?' he cried in a ****** tone. 

'Me!' replied the voice of the Dodger, through the ***-****. 

'What now?' cried the Jew impatiently. 

'Is he to be ********* to the other ***, Nancy says?' inquired the 



'Yes,' replied the Jew, '******** she **** hands on him.  Find him, find him out, that's all.  I shall know what to do next; never fear.' 

The boy ******** a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after his companions. 

'He has not ******* so far,' said the Jew as he pursued his **********. 'If he means to **** us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth 







CHAPTER *** 

********** FURTHER *********** OF OLIVER'S **** AT MR. ********'*, WITH THE ********** ********** WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED ********** HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ****** 

Oliver soon ********** from the ********-*** into which Mr. ********'* ****** *********** had ****** him, the subject of the ******* was carefully *******, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ******:  which indeed **** no ********* to Oliver's history or *********, but was ******** to such ****** as might ***** without ******** him.  He was still too weak to get up to *********; but, when he came down into the ***********'* room next day, his first *** was to cast an ***** glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.  His ************ were ************, however, for the ******* had been *******. 

'Ah!' said the ***********, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes. 'It is gone, you see.' 

'I see it is ma'am,' replied Oliver.  'Why have they taken it away?' 

'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to ***** you, perhaps it might ******* your ******* well, you know,' rejoined the old lady. 

'Oh, no, indeed.  It didn't ***** me, ma'am,' said Oliver. 'I ***** to see it.  I quite ***** it.' 

'Well, well!' said the old lady, ****-**********; 'you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There!  I promise you that!  Now, let us talk about something else.' 

This was all the *********** Oliver could ****** about the ******* at that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him in his *******, he *********** to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened *********** to a great many ******* she told him, about an ******* and ******** ******** of ****, who was ******* to an ******* and ******** man, and ***** in the country; and about a ***, who was ***** to a ******** in the **** ******; and who was, also, such a good young man, and ***** such ******* ******* home four times *-****, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had **********, a long time, on the *********** of her children, and the ****** of her kind good ******* besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just ***-***-****** years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to ***** Oliver ********: which he ****** as quickly as she could *****:  and at which game they ******, with great interest and *******, until it was time for the ******* to have some **** **** and water, with a ***** of *** *****, and then to go ****** to bed. 

They were happy days, those of Oliver's ********.  Everything was so quiet, and ****, and *******; ********* so kind and gentle; that after the noise and ********** in the ***** of which he had always *****, it seemed like Heaven itself.  He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, ********, than Mr. Brownlow ****** a ******** new suit, and a new ***, and a new pair of *****, to be ******** for him.  As Oliver was told that he might do what he ***** with the old clothes, he gave them to a ******* who had been very kind to him, and asked her to **** them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.  This she very ******* did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew **** them up in his *** and walk away, he felt quite ********* to think that they were ****** gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to **** them again.  They were *** ****, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before. 

One evening, about a week after the ****** of the *******, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a ******* down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his *****, and talk to him a little while. 

'Bless us, and save us!  **** your hands, and let me part your hair ****** for you, child,' said Mrs. Bedwin.  'Dear heart alive!  If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a ***** ****** on, and made you as ***** as ********!' 

Oliver did as the old lady **** him; and, although she ******** **********, meanwhile, that there was not even time to ***** the little ***** that ******** his *****-******; he looked so ******** and ********, ******* that ********* ******** *********, that she went so far as to say:  looking at him with great *********** from head to foot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the ******* notice, to have made much ********** in him for the better. 

Thus **********, Oliver ****** at the ***** door.  On Mr. Brownlow ******* to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little *******.  There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated *******.  When he saw Oliver, he ****** the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down. Oliver ********; ********** where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be ******* to make the world *****.  Which is still a ****** to more *********** people than Oliver Twist, every day of their *****. 

'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?' said Mr. Brownlow, ********* the ********* with which Oliver ******** the ******* that reached from the floor to the *******. 

'A great number, sir,' replied Oliver.  'I never saw so many.' 

'You shall read them, if you ****** well,' said the old gentleman ******; 'and you will like that, better than looking at the ********,--**** is, some *****; because there are books of which the ***** and ****** are by far the best *****.' 

'I suppose they are those heavy ****, sir,' said Oliver, pointing to some large *******, with a good deal of ******* about the *******. 

'Not always those,' said the old gentleman, ******* Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; 'there are other ******* heavy ****, though of a much ******* ****.  How should you like to **** up a ****** man, and ***** books, eh?' 

'I think I would rather read them, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'What! wouldn't you like to be a ****-******?' said the old gentleman. 

Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a ****-******; upon which the old gentleman laughed ********, and ******** he had said a very good thing. Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it 



'Well, well,' said the old gentleman, ********* his features. 'Don't be afraid!  We won't make an ****** of you, while there's an ****** trade to be ******, or *****-****** to turn to.' 

'Thank you, sir,' said Oliver.  At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a ******* ********, which Oliver, not *************, **** no very great attention 



'Now,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a ******, but at the same time in a much more ******* manner, than Oliver had ever known him ****** yet, 'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say.  I shall talk to you without any *******; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many ***** ******* would 



'Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!' exclaimed Oliver, ******* at the ******* tone of the old gentleman's ************!  'Don't turn me out of ***** to ****** in the streets again.  Let me **** here, and be a *******.  Don't send me back to the wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!' 

'My dear child,' said the old gentleman, moved by the ****** of Oliver's sudden ******; 'you need not be afraid of my ********* you, unless you give me cause.' 

'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver. 

'I hope not,' rejoined the old gentleman.  'I do not think you ever will.  I have been ********, before, in the ******* whom I have *********** to *******; but I feel ******** disposed to ***** you, ************; and I am more ********** in your ****** than I can well account for, even to myself.  The ******* on whom I have ******** my ******* love, lie deep in their ******; but, although the happiness and ******* of my life lie ****** there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and ****** it up, *******, on my best **********.  Deep ********** has but ************ and ******* them.' 

As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still. 

'Well, well!' said the old gentleman at length, in a more ******** tone, 'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have ******** great pain and ******, you will be more *******, perhaps, not to ***** me again.  You say you are an ******, without a friend in the world; all the ********* I have been able to make, ******* the *********.  Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.  Speak the truth, and you shall not be ********** while I live.' 

Oliver's **** ******* his ********* for some minutes; when he was on the point of ********* to ****** how he had been brought up at the ****, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a ********** ********* little ******-***** was heard at the ******-****:  and the *******, running upstairs, ********* Mr. Grimwig. 

'Is he coming up?' inquired Mr. Brownlow. 

'Yes, sir,' replied the *******.  'He asked if there were any ******* in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.' 

Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little ***** in his *******; for he was a worthy creature at ******, as he had reason to know. 

'Shall I go downstairs, sir?' inquired Oliver. 

'No,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'I would rather you remained here.' 

At this moment, there walked into the room:  ********** himself by a thick stick:  a ***** old gentleman, rather **** in one ***, who was ******* in a **** coat, ******* waistcoat, ******* ******** and *******, and a *****-******* white hat, with the ***** turned up with green.  A very *****-******* ***** ***** ***** out from his waistcoat; and a very long ***** *****-*****, with nothing but a key at the end, ******* ******* below it.  The **** of his white *********** were ******* into a **** about the **** of an ******; the ******* of ****** into which his countenance was *******, **** ***********.  He had a manner of ******** his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the ******* of his eyes at the same time:  which ************ ******** the ******** of a ******.  In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, ******* out a small piece of ******-**** at arm's length, exclaimed, in a ********, ************ 



'Look here! do you see this!  Isn't it a most ********* and ************* thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor *******'* friend on the *********? I've been ***** with ******-**** once, and I know ******-**** will be my death, or I'll be ******* to eat my own head, sir!' 

This was the ******** ***** with which Mr. Grimwig ****** and ********* nearly every ********* he made; and it was the more ******** in his case, because, even ********* for the sake of ********, the *********** of ********** ************ being brought to that **** which will ****** a gentleman to eat his own head in the ***** of his being so disposed, Mr. *******'* head was such a ************ large one, that the most ******** man alive could hardly ********* a hope of being able to get through it at a *******--** put ******** out of the question, a very thick ******* of ******. 

'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, ******** his stick upon the ground.  '*****! what's that!' looking at Oliver, and ********** a pace or two. 

'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr. 



Oliver *****. 

'You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?' said Mr. Grimwig, ********* a little more.  '**** a minute! Don't speak! Stop--' continued Mr. Grimwig, ********, ****** all ***** of the fever in his ******* at the *********; 'that's the boy who had the ******! If that's not the boy, sir, who had the ******, and threw this bit of **** upon the *********, I'll eat my head, and his too.' 

'No, no, he has not had one,' said Mr. Brownlow, ********. 'Come!  Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.' 

'I feel ******** on this subject, sir,' said the ********* old gentleman, drawing off his ******.  'There's always more or less ******-**** on the ******** in our street; and I _know_ it's put there by the *******'* boy at the corner.  A young woman ******** over a bit last night, and fell against my ******-********; directly she got up I saw her look towards his ******** red **** with the *********-*****. "Don't go to him," I called out of the window, "he's an ********!  A ***-****!"  So he is.  If he is not--'  Here the ********* old gentleman gave a great ***** on the ground with his stick; which was always **********, by his friends, to ***** the ********* *****, ******** it was not ********* in words. Then, still ******* his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a ****** ***-*****, which he **** ******** to a ***** black ******, took a view of Oliver:  who, seeing that he was the object of **********, ********, and ***** again. 

'That's the boy, is it?' said Mr. Grimwig, at length. 

'That's the boy,' replied Mr. Brownlow. 

'How are you, boy?' said Mr. Grimwig. 

'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver. 

Mr. Brownlow, ******* to ********* that his ******** friend was about to say something ************, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the *******'* manner, he was very happy to do. 

'He is a ****-******* boy, is he not?' inquired Mr. Brownlow. 

'I don't know,' replied Mr. Grimwig, *********. 

'Don't know?' 

'No.  I don't know.  I never see any ********** in boys.  I only knew two sort of boys.  ***** boys, and ****-***** boys.' 

'And which is Oliver?' 

'*****.  I know a friend who has a ****-***** boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red ******, and ******* eyes; a ****** boy; with a body and ***** that ****** to be ******** out of the ***** of his **** clothes; with the voice of a *****, and the ******** of a ****.  I know him!  The ******!' 

'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the *************** of young Oliver Twist; so he *****'* ****** your *****.' 

'They are not,' replied Mr. Grimwig.  'He may have worse.' 

Here, Mr. Brownlow ******* impatiently; which appeared to ****** Mr. Grimwig the most ********* *******. 

'He may have worse, I say,' repeated Mr. Grimwig.  'Where does he come from!  Who is he?  What is he?  He has had a fever.  What of that? ****** are not ******** to good people; are they?  Bad people have ****** sometimes; haven't they, eh?  I knew a man who was hung in ******* for ********* his master.  He had had a fever six times; he wasn't *********** to mercy on that account.  ****! ********!' 

Now, the fact was, that in the ****** ******** of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was ******** disposed to ***** that Oliver's appearance and manner were ********* *************; but he had a strong ******** for *************, ********* on this occasion by the finding of the ******-****; and, ******** *********** that no man should ******* to him whether a boy was ****-******* or not, he had resolved, from the first, to ****** his friend.  When Mr. Brownlow ******** that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a ************ answer; and that he had ********* any ************* into Oliver's previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig ******** ***********.  And he demanded, with a *****, whether the *********** was in the ***** of ******** the ***** at night; because if she didn't find a *****-***** or two ******* some ******** morning, why, he would be ******* **--*** so forth. 

All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself ******** of an ********* gentleman:  knowing his friend's *************, **** with great good ******; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was ********** ******* to ******* his ****** ******** of the *******, matters went on very ********; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his **** than he had yet done in the ****** old gentleman's presence. 

'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and ********** of Oliver Twist?' asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the ********** of the ****; looking ******** at Oliver, as he resumed his subject. 

'To-morrow morning,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'I would rather he was alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, my dear.' 

'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.  He answered with some **********, because he was ******** by Mr. *******'* looking so hard at him. 

'I'll tell you what,' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; 'he won't come up to you to-morrow morning.  I saw him ********. He is ********* you, my good friend.' 

'I'll ***** he is not,' replied Mr. Brownlow, ******. 

'If he is not,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'I'll--' and down went the stick. 

'I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!' said Mr. Brownlow, ******** the table. 

'And I for his ********* with my head!' rejoined Mr. Grimwig, ******** the table also. 

'We shall see,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******** his rising *****. 

'We will,' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a ********* smile;  'we will.' 

As **** would have it, Mrs. Bedwin ******* to bring in, at this moment, a small ****** of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning ********* of the ********* *********-******, who has already ******* in this history; having laid them on the table, she ******** to leave the room. 

'Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!' said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to go back.' 

'He has gone, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin. 

'Call after him,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'it's particular.  He is a poor man, and they are not **** for.  There are some books to be taken back, 



The ******-**** was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and ******** for the boy; but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl returned, in a ********** state, to ****** that there were no ******* of him. 

'Dear me, I am very ***** for that,' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; 'I ************ ****** those books to be returned to-night.' 

'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ******** smile; 'he will be sure to ******* them ******, you know.' 

'Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,' said Oliver. 'I'll run all the way, sir.' 

The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most ********* ***** from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his ****** ********* of the **********, he should ***** to him the ********* of his **********:  on this head at least:  at once. 

'You _shall_ go, my dear,' said the old gentleman.  'The books are on a chair by my table.  ***** them down.' 

Oliver, ********* to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great ******; and ******, *** in hand, to hear what ******* he was to 



'You are to say,' said Mr. Brownlow, glancing ******** at Grimwig; 'you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I *** him.  This is a ****-***** ****, so you will have to bring me back, ten ********* change.' 

'I won't be ten minutes, sir,' said Oliver, eagerly.  Having ******** up the ****-**** in his ****** pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a ********** ***, and left the room.  Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the ******-****, giving him many ********** about the ******* way, and the name of the **********, and the name of the street:  all of which Oliver said he ******* **********.  Having ********** many *********** to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length ********* him to ******. 

'Bless his sweet face!' said the old lady, looking after him. 'I can't bear, *******, to let him go out of my sight.' 

At this moment, Oliver looked ***** round, and nodded before he turned the corner.  The old lady ********* returned his **********, and, ******* the door, went back to her own room. 

'Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the *******,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* out his watch, and ******* it on the table.  'It will be dark by that time.' 

'Oh! you really ****** him to come back, do you?' inquired Mr. Grimwig. 

'Don't you?' asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling. 

The ****** of ************* was strong in Mr. *******'* breast, at the moment; and it was rendered ******** by his friend's ********* smile. 

'No,' he said, ******* the table with his ****, 'I do not. The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of ******** books under his arm, and a ****-***** **** in his pocket.  He'll **** his old friends the *******, and laugh at you.  If ever that boy ******* to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.' 

With these words he drew his chair ****** to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent ***********, with the watch between them. 

It is worthy of remark, as ************ the ********** we ****** to our own *********, and the ***** with which we put forth our most **** and ***** ***********, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a ***-******* man, and though he would have been *********** ***** to see his ********* friend ***** and ********, he really did most ********* and ******** hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back. 

It grew so dark, that the ******* on the ****-***** were scarcely ***********; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them. 





CHAPTER ** 

******* HOW VERY **** OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY 



In the ******* parlour of a low public-house, in the ********* part of Little ******* Hill; a dark and gloomy ***, where a ******* ***-***** ***** all day in the ******-****; and where no *** of *** ever ***** in the ******:  there sat, ******** over a little ****** ******* and a small glass, ******** *********** with the ***** of ******, a man in a ********* coat, **** ******, ****-***** and *********, whom even by that *** light no *********** ***** of the ****** would have ********* to ********* as Mr. ******* Sikes.  At his feet, sat a *****-******, ***-**** dog; who ******** himself, ***********, in ******* at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in ******* a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the ****** of some ****** ********. 

'Keep quiet, you *******!  Keep quiet!' said Mr. Sikes, suddenly ******** silence.  Whether his *********** were so ******* as to be ********* by the dog's *******, or whether his feelings were so ******* upon by his *********** that they ******** all the ****** ********* from ******* an *********** ****** to ***** them, is matter for ******** and consideration.  ******** was the cause, the effect was a **** and a *****, ******** upon the dog **************. 

Dogs are not ********* *** to ******* ******** ********* upon them by their *******; but Mr. *****'* dog, having ****** of ****** in common with his *****, and *********, perhaps, at this moment, under a ******** sense of ******, made no more *** but at once fixed his teeth in one of the ****-*****.  Having given in a ****** *****, he *******, ********, under a form; just ******** the ****** ******* which Mr. Sikes ******** at his head. 

'You would, would you?' said Sikes, ******* the ***** in one hand, and ************ opening with the other a large *****-*****, which he drew from his pocket.  'Come here, you born devil!  Come here!  *'** hear?' 

The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very ******** key of a very ***** voice; but, ********* to ********* some ************* ********* to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more ******** than before:  at the same time ******** the end of the ***** between his teeth, and ****** at it like a **** 



This ********** only ********** Mr. Sikes the more; who, ******** on his knees, began to ****** the ****** most *********.  The dog ****** from right to left, and from left to right; ********, ********, and *******; the man thrust and *****, and struck and **********; and the ******** was ******** a most ******** point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog ****** out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the ***** and the *****-***** in his hands. 

There must always be two ******* to a *******, says the old *****.  Mr. Sikes, being ************ of the dog's *************, at once *********** his ***** in the ******* to the new *****. 

'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?' said Sikes, with a ****** *******. 

'I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,' replied Fagin, ******; for the Jew was the new *****. 

'Didn't know, you *****-******* thief!' growled Sikes. 'Couldn't you hear the noise?' 

'Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,' replied the Jew. 

'Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a ****** *****.  '******** in and out, so as nobody ***** how you come or go!  I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.' 

'Why?' inquired the Jew with a forced smile. 

'Cause the **********, as ***** for the ***** of such men as you, as haven't half the ***** of ****, **** a man **** a dog how he *****,' replied Sikes, ******** up the ***** with a very ********** look; 'that's why.' 

The Jew ****** his hands; and, sitting down at the table, ******** to laugh at the ********** of his friend.  He was ********* very ill at ****, however. 

'Grin away,' said Sikes, ********* the *****, and ********* him with ****** ********; 'grin away.  You'll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a ********.  I've got the ***** hand over you, Fagin; and, *--**, I'll keep it.  There!  If I go, you go; so take care of me.' 

'Well, well, my dear,' said the Jew, 'I know all that; **--**--**** a ****** interest, ****,--* ****** interest.' 

'*****,' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew's side than on his.  'Well, what have you got to say to me?' 

'It's all passed safe through the *******-***,' replied Fagin, 'and this is your *****.  It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--' 

'**** that ******,' interposed the robber, impatiently. 'Where is it? Hand over!' 

'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew, **********.  'Here it is!  All safe!'  As he spoke, he drew forth an old ****** handkerchief from his breast; and ******* a large **** in one corner, ******** a small *****-***** ******.  Sikes, ********* it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to ***** the ********** it 



'This is all, is it?' inquired Sikes. 

'All,' replied the Jew. 

'You haven't opened the ****** and ********* one or two as you come along, have you?' inquired Sikes, ************. 'Don't put on an ******* look at the question; you've done it many a time. **** the 



These words, in ***** *******, ******** an ********** to **** the bell. It was answered by another Jew:  ******* than Fagin, but nearly as **** and ********* in appearance. 

Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty *******.  The Jew, perfectly ************* the ****, ******* to **** it:  ********** ********** a ********** look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in *********** of it, and shook his head in reply; so ******** that the action would have been almost ************* to an ********* ***** person.  It was lost upon Sikes, who was ******** at the moment to *** the ****-**** which the dog had ****.  ********, if he had observed the brief *********** of *******, he might have thought that it ***** no good to him. 

'Is anybody here, Barney?' inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground. 

'*** a *****,' replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the heart or not:  made their way through the nose. 

'Nobody?' inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might mean that Barney was at ******* to tell the truth. 

'****** but **** *****,' replied Barney. 

'Nancy!' exclaimed Sikes.  'Where?  ****** me *****, if I don't honour that '*** girl, for her ****** *******.' 

'She's *** ***** a ***** of ****** **** id the ***,' replied Barney. 

'Send her here,' said Sikes, ******* out a glass of ******. 'Send her 



Barney looked ******* at Fagin, as if for **********; the Jew ********* silent, and not ******* his eyes from the ground, he *******; and ********* returned, ******** in Nancy; who was ********* with the ******, *****, ******, and ******-**** key, ********. 

'You are on the *****, are you, Nancy?' inquired Sikes, ********** the 



'Yes, I am, Bill,' replied the young lady, ********* of its ********; 'and ***** enough of it I am, too.  The young ****'* been ill and ******** to the ****; and--' 

'Ah, Nancy, dear!' said Fagin, looking up. 

Now, whether a ******** *********** of the Jew's red ***-*****, and a half ******* of his ******-*** eyes, ****** Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too *************, is not a matter of much **********. The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly ******* herself, and with several ******** ****** upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes' time, Mr. Fagin was ****** with a fit of ********; upon which Nancy ****** her ***** over her shoulders, and ******** it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, ********* his ********* of ************ her; they went away together, followed, at a little *******, by the dog, who ***** out of a ****-**** as soon as his master was out of sight. 

The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his ******** ****; muttered a deep *****; and then, with a ******** grin, ******** himself at the table; where he was soon ****** ******** in the *********** ***** of the ***-***-***. 

Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little ******** that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the ****-*****.  When he got into ***********, he ********** turned down a **-****** which was not ******* in his way; but not *********** his ******* until he had got ****-*** down it, and knowing it must **** in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so ******* on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm. 

He was walking along, thinking how happy and ********* he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little ****, who, ******* and ******, might be ******* ******** at that very moment; when he was ******** by a young woman ********* out very loud.  'Oh, my dear *******!'  And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms ****** ***** round his neck. 

'Don't,' cried Oliver, **********.  'Let go of me.  Who is it? What are you stopping me for?' 

The only reply to this, was a great number of loud ************ from the young woman who had ******** him; and who had a little ****** and a ******-**** key in her hand. 

'Oh my ********!' said the young woman, 'I have found him!  Oh! Oliver! Oliver!  Oh you ******* boy, to make me ****** such ******** on your account!  Come home, dear, come.  Oh, I've found him.  Thank ******** goodness *******, I've found him!'  With these ********** ************, the young woman burst into another fit of ******, and got so ********** **********, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a *******'* boy with a ***** head of hair ******** with ****, who was also looking on, whether he didn't think he had better run for the doctor.  To which, the *******'* boy:  who appeared of a ********, not to say ******** ***********:  replied, that he thought not. 

'Oh, no, no, never mind,' said the young woman, ******** Oliver's hand; 'I'm better now.  Come home directly, you ***** boy! Come!' 

'Oh, ma'am,' replied the young woman, 'he ran away, near a ***** ago, from his *******, who are ****-******* and *********** people; and went and ****** a set of ******* and bad **********; and almost ***** his ******'* heart.' 

'Young ******!' said one woman. 

'Go home, do, you little *****,' said the other. 

'I am not,' replied Oliver, ******* *******.  'I don't know her. I haven't any ******, or father and mother either.  I'm an ******; I live at ***********.' 

'Only hear him, how he ****** it out!' cried the young woman. 

'Why, it's Nancy!' exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in ************* astonishment. 

'You see he knows me!' cried Nancy, ********* to the **********. 'He can't help himself.  Make him come home, there's good people, or he'll **** his dear mother and father, and ***** my heart!' 

'What the *****'* this?' said a man, ******** out of a ****-****, with a white dog at his *****; 'young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young dog!  Come home directly.' 

'I don't ****** to them.  I don't know them.  Help! help!' cried Oliver, ********** in the man's ******** *****. 

'Help!' repeated the man.  'Yes; I'll help you, you young ******! 

What books are these?  You've been a ******** 'em, have you? Give 'em here.'  With these words, the man **** the ******* from his *****, and struck him on the head. 

'That's right!' cried a ******-**, from a ******-******. 'That's the only way of ******** him to his ******!' 

'To be sure!' cried a ******-***** *********, ******* an ********* look at the ******-******. 

'**'** do him good!' said the two women. 

'And he shall have it, too!' rejoined the man, ************* another blow, and ******* Oliver by the ******.  'Come on, you young *******! Here, ****'*-***, mind him, boy!  Mind him!' 

Weak with ****** *******; ********* by the ***** and the ********** of the ******; ********* by the ****** ******** of the dog, and the ********* of the man; *********** by the ********** of the ********** that he really was the ******** little ****** he was ********* to be; what could one poor child do!  Darkness had set in; it was a low ************; no help was near; ********** was *******.  In another moment he was ******* into a ********* of dark narrow ******, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few ***** he ***** to give ********* to, **************.  It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were ************ or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so *****. 



      *      *      *      *      * 

The ***-***** were *******; Mrs. Bedwin was ******* ********* at the open door; the ******* had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any ****** of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, *************, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them. 





CHAPTER *** 

******* WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN ******* BY NANCY 

The narrow streets and ******, at length, ********** in a large open space; ********* about which, were **** for ******, and other *********** of a ******-******.  Sikes ********* his pace when they reached this spot:  the girl being quite ****** to ******* any longer, the ***** **** at which they had ******** walked.  Turning to Oliver, he ******* ********* him to take hold of *****'* hand. 

'Do you hear?' growled Sikes, as Oliver *********, and looked round. 

They were in a dark corner, quite out of the ***** of **********. 

Oliver saw, but too *******, that ********** would be of no *****.  He held out his hand, which Nancy ******* ***** in ****. 

'Give me the other,' said Sikes, ******* Oliver's ********** hand. 'Here, ****'*-***!' 

The dog looked up, and growled. 

'See here, boy!' said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver's throat; 'if he ****** ever so **** a word, hold him!  *'** mind!' 

The dog growled again; and ******* his lips, **** Oliver as if he were anxious to ****** himself to his ******** without *****. 

'He's as ******* as a *********, ****** me ***** if he isn't!' said Sikes, ********* the ****** with a kind of **** and ********* ********. 'Now, you know what you've got to ******, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.  Get on, *****'**!' 

****'*-*** ****** his **** in ************** of this ********* ********* form of ******; and, giving **** to another ********** ***** for the ******* of Oliver, led the way ******. 

It was ********** that they were ********, although it might have been ********* ******, for anything Oliver knew to the ********. The night was dark and *****.  The ****** in the ***** could ********* ******** through the heavy ****, which ********* every moment and ******** the streets and houses in *****; ********* the strange place still stranger in Oliver's eyes; and making his *********** the more ****** and 



They had hurried on a few *****, when a deep ******-**** struck the hour.  With its first ******, his two ********** stopped, and turned their heads in the direction ****** the sound proceeded. 

'***** *' *****, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ******. 

'What's the good of ******* me that; I can hear it, can't I!' replied 



'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy. 

'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.  'It was ******** time when I was *******; and there ****'* a ***** ******* in the ****, as I couldn't hear the ********* on.  ***** I was locked up for the night, the *** and *** outside made the ********** old **** so silent, that I could almost have beat my ****** out against the iron ****** of the door.' 

'Poor fellow!' said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had *******.  'Oh, Bill, such fine young ***** as them!' 

'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes.  'Fine young *****!  Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.' 

With this ***********, Mr. Sikes appeared to ******* a rising ******** to ********, and, ******** Oliver's ***** more firmly, told him to step out again. 

'**** a minute!' said the girl:  'I wouldn't ***** by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time ***** o'clock struck, Bill.  I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the **** was on the ground, and I ****'* a ***** to ***** me.' 

'And what good would that do?' inquired the ************* Mr. Sikes. 'Unless you could ***** over a **** and twenty ***** of good ***** ****, you might as well be walking ***** **** off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me.  Come on, and don't stand ********* there.' 

The girl burst into a laugh; drew her ***** more ******* round her; and they walked away.  But Oliver felt her hand *******, and, looking up in her face as they passed a ***-****, saw that it had turned a ****** 



They walked on, by ******-********** and dirty ****, for a full ****-****:  ******* very few people, and those ********* from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a very ****** narrow street, nearly full of ***-******* *****; the dog running forward, as if ********* that there was no further occasion for his ******* on *****, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently **********; the house was in a ******* condition, and on the door was ****** a board, ********** that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many 



'All right,' cried Sikes, glancing ********** about. 

Nancy ******* below the ********, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a ****.  A noise, as if a **** window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.  Mr. Sikes then ****** the ********* boy by the ****** with very little ********; and all three were quickly inside the house. 

The passage was perfectly dark.  They ******, while the person who had let them in, ******* and ****** the door. 

'Anybody here?' inquired Sikes. 

'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before. 

'Is the old '** here?' asked the robber. 

'Yes,' replied the voice, 'and ******** down in the mouth he has been. Won't he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!' 

The ***** of this reply, as well as the voice which ********* it, seemed ******** to Oliver's ears:  but it was ********** to *********** even the form of the ******* in the darkness. 

'***'* have a ****,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go ******** our *****, or ******** on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!' 

'Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,' replied the voice. The ******** ********* of the ******* were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. **** Dawkins, ********* the Artful Dodger, appeared. He **** in his right hand a ****** candle ***** in the end of a ***** 



The young gentleman did not stop to ****** any other **** of *********** upon Oliver than a ********* grin; but, turning away, ******** the ******** to follow him down a ****** of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low ******-******** room, which seemed to have been ***** in a small ****-****, were received with a ***** of ********. 

'Oh, my ***, my ***!' cried Master ******* Bates, from whose ***** the ******** had proceeded:  'here he is! oh, cry, here he is!  Oh, Fagin, look at him!  Fagin, do look at him! I can't bear it; it is such a ***** game, I cant' bear it.  Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.' 

With this ************* ********** of *****, Master Bates laid himself **** on the floor: and ****** ************ for five minutes, in an ****** of ********* joy.  Then ******* to his feet, he ******** the ***** stick from the Dodger; and, ********* to Oliver, ****** him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his ********, made a great number of low **** to the ********** boy.  The Artful, ********, who was of a rather ********* ***********, and ****** gave way to ********* when it ********** with business, ****** Oliver's pockets with ****** *********. 

'Look at his ****, Fagin!' said Charley, putting the light so close to his new ****** as nearly to set him on fire.  'Look at his ****! ********* *****, and the heavy ***** cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!' 

'********* to see you looking so well, my dear,' said the Jew, ****** with **** ********.  'The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should ***** that ****** one.  Why didn't you *****, my dear, and say you were coming?  **'* have got something **** for 



At his, Master Bates ****** again: so loud, that Fagin himself *******, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the ****-***** **** at that instant, it is ******** whether the ***** of the ********* awakened his *********. 

'*****, what's that?' inquired Sikes, ******** forward as the Jew ****** the ****.  'That's mine, Fagin.' 

'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew.  'Mine, Bill, mine.  You shall have the books.' 

'If that ain't mine!' said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; 'mine and *****'* that is; I'll take the boy back 



The Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he ***** that the ******* might really end in his being taken back. 

'Come!  Hand over, will you?' said Sikes. 

'This is hardly ****, Bill; hardly ****, is it, Nancy?' inquired the 



'****, or not ****,' retorted Sikes, 'hand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our ******** time but to ***** it in ******** *****, and **********, every young boy as **** ******* through you?  Give it here, you ********** old ********, give it here!' 

With this gentle ************, Mr. Sikes ******* the **** from between the Jew's ****** and *****; and looking the old man ****** in the face, ****** it up small, and **** it in his ***********. 

'That's for our ***** of the trouble,' said Sikes; 'and not half enough, neither.  You may keep the books, if you're **** of *******. If you ain't, **** 'em.' 

'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with ****** ********, had been ********* to read one of the ******* in question; 'beautiful *******, isn't is, Oliver?'  At sight of the ******** look with which Oliver ******** his **********, Master Bates, who was ******* with a ****** sense of the *********, fell into another ******, more ********** than the first. 

'They ****** to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, ******** his hands; 'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me ******, when I was near ***** of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money.  Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back.  He'll think I ***** them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I ***** them.  Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!' 

With these words, which were uttered with all the ****** of ********** *****, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands together, in ******* ***********. 

'The boy's right,' ******** Fagin, looking ******** round, and ******** his ****** ******** into a hard ****.  'You're right, Oliver, you're right; they WILL think you have ****** 'em.  Ha! ha!' ******** the Jew, ******* his hands, 'it couldn't have happened better, if we had ****** our time!' 

'Of course it couldn't,' replied Sikes; 'I ****'* that, directly I see him coming through ***********, with the books under his arm.  It's all right enough.  They're ****-******* *****-*******, or they wouldn't have taken him in at all; and ****'** ask no ********* after him, fear they should be ******* to *********, and so get him ******.  He's safe 



Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were **********, and could ********* understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes *********, he ****** suddenly to his feet, and **** ****** from the room:  ******** ******* for help, which made the **** old house **** to the ****. 

'Keep back the dog, Bill!' cried Nancy, ********* before the door, and ******* it, as the Jew and his two ****** ****** out in *******.  'Keep back the dog; he'll **** the boy to ******.' 

'***** him right!' cried Sikes, ********** to ********* himself from the ****'* *****.  'Stand off from me, or I'll ***** your head against the wall.' 

'I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,' ******** the girl, ********** ********* with the man, 'the child ****'* be **** down by the dog, unless you **** me first.' 

'****'* he!' said Sikes, ******* his teeth.  'I'll soon do that, if you don't keep off.' 

The ************ ***** the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, ******** Oliver among 



'What's the matter here!' said Fagin, looking round. 

'The ****'* gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, ********. 

'No, she ****'*,' said Nancy, pale and ********** from the *******; 'no, she ****'*, Fagin; don't think it.' 

'Then keep quiet, will you?' said the Jew, with a *********** look. 

'No, I won't do that, neither,' replied Nancy, speaking very loud. 'Come!  What do you think of that?' 

Mr. Fagin was ************ well ********** with the ******* and ******* of that particular ******* of ******** to which Nancy ********, to feel ********* certain that it would be rather ****** to ******* any conversation with her, at present.  With the view of ********* the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver. 

'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' said the Jew, taking up a ****** and ******* **** which *** in a corner of the *********; 'eh?' 

Oliver made no reply.  But he watched the Jew's *******, and ******** 



'Wanted to get **********; called for the ******; did you?' ******* the Jew, catching the boy by the arm.  'We'll **** you of that, my young 



The Jew ********* a ***** blow on Oliver's shoulders with the ****; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, ******* forward, ******* it from his hand.  She ***** it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the ******* ***** ******** out into the room. 

'I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl. 'You've got the boy, and what more would you ****?--*** him **--*** him **--** I shall put that **** on some of you, that will bring me to the ******* before my time.' 

The girl ******* her foot ********* on the floor as she ****** this ******; and with her lips **********, and her hands ********, looked *********** at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite ********** from the passion of **** into which she had gradually ****** herself. 

'Why, Nancy!' said the Jew, in a ******** tone; after a *****, during which he and Mr. Sikes had ****** at one another in a ************ manner; '***,--***'** more ****** than ever to-night.  Ha! ha! my dear, you are ****** ***********.' 

'Am I!' said the girl.  'Take care I don't ****** it.  You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.' 

There is something about a roused woman: ********** if she *** to all her other strong ********, the ****** ******** of ************ and *******; which few men like to *******. The Jew saw that it would be ******** to ****** any further ******* ********* the ******* of Miss *****'* ****; and, ********* ************* back a few *****, cast a glance, half ********* and half ********, at Sikes: as if to **** that he was the ******* person to ****** the ********. 

Mr. Sikes, thus ****** ******** to; and ******** feeling his ******** ***** and ********* ********** in the ********* ********* of Miss Nancy to reason; gave ********* to about a couple of ***** of ****** and *******, the ***** ********** of which ********* great ****** on the ********* of his *********. As they ******** no ******* effect on the object against whom they were **********, however, he ******** to more ******** *********. 

'What do you mean by this?' said Sikes; ******* the inquiry with a very common *********** ********** the most beautiful of ***** features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every ***** ******** times that it is uttered below, would ****** ********* as common a ******** as *******: 'what do you mean by it?  **** my body!  Do you know who you are, and what you are?' 

'Oh, yes, I know all about it,' replied the girl, ******** ************; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor ********** of ************. 

'Well, then, keep quiet,' rejoined Sikes, with a ***** like that he was ********** to use when ********** his dog, 'or I'll quiet you for a good long time to come.' 

The girl laughed again: even less ********** than before; and, ******* a ***** look at Sikes, turned her face *****, and bit her *** till the blood came. 

'You're a **** one,' added Sikes, as he ******** her with a ************ air, 'to take up the ****** and ***--**** side!  A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!' 

'God ******** help me, I am!' cried the girl ************; 'and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed ****** with them we passed so near to-night, before I had **** a hand in ******** him here.  He's a thief, a ****, a devil, all that's bad, from this night forth.  Isn't that enough for the old ******, without *****?' 

'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew ********* to him in a ************* tone, and ********* towards the boys, who were eagerly ********* to all that passed; 'we must have ***** words; ***** words, Bill.' 

'***** words!' cried the girl, whose passion was ********* to see. '***** words, you *******!  Yes, you ******* 'em from me. I ******* for you when I was a child not half as old as this!' pointing to Oliver. 'I have been in the same trade, and in the same *******, for ****** years since.  Don't you know it?  Speak out!  Don't you know it?' 

'Well, well,' replied the Jew, with an ******* at ************; 'and, if you have, it's your living!' 

'***, it is!' returned the girl; not speaking, but ******* out the words in one ********** and ******** ******.  'It is my living; and the cold, ***, dirty streets are my home; and you're the ****** that ***** me to them long ago, and ****'** keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!' 

'I shall do you a ********!' interposed the Jew, ****** by these **********; 'a ******** worse than that, if you say much more!' 

The girl said nothing more; but, ******* her hair and ***** in a ********* of passion, made such a **** at the Jew as would ******** have left ****** ***** of her ******* upon him, had not her ****** been ****** by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few *********** *********, and *******. 

'She's all right now,' said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. 'She's ******** strong in the arms, when she's up in this way.' 

The Jew ***** his ********: and smiled, as if it were a ****** to have the *********** over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to ******** it in any other light than a common ********* ********** to business. 

'It's the ***** of having to do with women,' said the Jew, ********* his ****; 'but they're ******, and we can't get on, in our ****, without 'em.  Charley, show Oliver to bed.' 

'I suppose he'd better not **** his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?' inquired Charley Bates. 

'Certainly not,' replied the Jew, ************* the grin with which Charley put the question. 

Master Bates, apparently much ********* with his **********, took the ***** stick: and led Oliver into an ******** kitchen, where there were two or three of the **** on which he had ***** before; and here, with many ************** ****** of ********, he ******** the ********* old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much ************* himself upon leaving off at Mr. ********'*; and the ********** ******* of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who ********* them, had been the very first **** received, of his **********. 

'Put off the ***** ****,' said Charley, 'and I'll give 'em to Fagin to take care of.  What *** it is!' 

Poor Oliver *********** ********.  Master Bates ******* up the new clothes under his arm, ******** from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and ******* the door behind him. 

The noise of *******'* ********, and the voice of Miss *****, who *********** arrived to ***** water over her friend, and ******* other ******** ******* for the ********* of her ********, might have kept many people ***** under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed.  But he was sick and *****; and he soon fell sound 







CHAPTER **** 

OLIVER'S ******* ********** ************, ****** A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO ****** HIS ********** 

It is the ****** on the *****, in all good ********* **********, to present the ****** and the ***** ******, in as ******* ***********, as the ****** of red and white in a side of ******* *****.  The **** ***** upon his ***** bed, ******* down by ******* and ***********; in the next scene, his ******** but *********** ****** ******* the ******** with a ***** ****.  We ******, with ********* ******, the ******* in the ***** of a ***** and ******** *****: her ****** and her life ***** in danger, drawing forth her ****** to ******** the one at the **** of the other; and just as our ************ are ******* up to the ******* *****, a ******* is heard, and we are *********** *********** to the great **** of the ******; where a ****-****** ********* ***** a ***** ****** with a ******* body of *******, who are free of all ***** of ******, from church ****** to *******, and **** about in company, ********* ***********. 

Such ******* ****** ******; but they are not so ********* as they would **** at first sight.  The *********** in real life from ****-****** ****** to *****-****, and from ********-***** to ******* ********, are not a **** less *********; only, there, we are **** ******, ******* of ******* *******-**, which ***** a **** **********.  The ****** in the ***** life of the *******, are ***** to violent *********** and ****** ******** of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere **********, are at once ********* as ********** and ************. 

As sudden ********* of the scene, and ***** ******* of time and place, are not only ********** in books by long *****, but are by many considered as the great *** of **********: an ******'* ***** in his ***** being, by such *******, ******* ********* with ******** to the ******** in which he ****** his ********** at the end of every chapter: this brief ************ to the present one may perhaps be ****** ***********.  If so, let it be considered a ******** ********** on the part of the ********* that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the ****** taking it for ******* that there are good and *********** ******* for making the *******, or he would not be ******* to ******* upon such an **********. 

Mr. Bumble ******* at early morning from the *********-****, and walked with ****** ******** and ********** steps, up the High Street.  He was in the full ***** and ***** of **********; his cocked hat and coat were ******** in the morning ***; he ******** his cane with the ******** ******** of ****** and power.  Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was ****** than usual.  There was an *********** in his eye, an ********* in his air, which might have ****** an ********* stranger that thoughts were passing in the ******'* mind, too great for 



Mr. Bumble stopped not to ******** with the small *********** and others who spoke to him, *************, as he passed along.  He merely returned their *********** with a **** of his hand, and ******* not in his ********* pace, until he reached the **** where Mrs. Mann ****** the ****** paupers with ********* care. 

'**** that beadle!' said Mrs. Mann, ******* the ****-***** shaking at the ******-****.  'If it isn't him at this time in the morning!  ****, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you!  Well, dear me, it IS a pleasure, this is!  Come into the parlour, sir, please.' 

The first ******** was addressed to *****; and the ************ of ******* were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady ******** the ******-****: and showed him, with great attention and *******, into the 



'Mrs. Mann,' said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or ******** himself into a seat, as any common ********** would: but ******* himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; 'Mrs. Mann, ma'am, good 



'Well, and good morning to _you_, sir,' replied Mrs. Mann, with many ******; 'and ****** you find yourself well, sir!' 

'**-**, Mrs. Mann,' replied the beadle.  'A porochial life is not a bed of *****, Mrs. Mann.' 

'Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,' rejoined the lady. And all the ****** paupers might have ********* the ********* with great *********, if they had heard it. 

'A porochial life, ma'am,' continued Mr. Bumble, ******** the table with his cane, 'is a life of ******, and ********, and *********; but all public **********, as I may say, must ****** ***********.' 

Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle *****, raised her hands with a look of ********, and ******. 

'Ah!  You may well ****, Mrs. Mann!' said the beadle. 

Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann ****** again:  ********* to the satisfaction of the public *********:  who, ********** a ********** smile by looking ******* at his cocked hat, said, 

'Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.' 

'****, Mr. Bumble!' cried Mrs. Mann, starting back. 

'To London, ma'am,' resumed the ********** beadle, 'by coach.  I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann!  A ***** action is a coming on, about a **********; and the board has ********* **--**, Mrs. ****--** ******* to the matter before the *******-******** at ***********. 

And I very much question,' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, 'whether the *********** ******** will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.' 

'Oh! you *****'* be too hard upon them, sir,' said Mrs. Mann, *********. 

'The *********** ******** have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble; 'and if the *********** ******** find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the *********** ******** have only themselves to thank.' 

There was so much ************* and ***** of purpose about the ******** manner in which Mr. Bumble ********* himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite **** by them. At length she said, 

'You're going by coach, sir?  I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in *****.' 

'That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann,' said the beadle.  'We put the sick paupers into open ***** in the ***** *******, to ******* their taking cold.' 

'Oh!' said Mrs. Mann. 

'The ********** coach ********* for these two; and ***** them *****,' said Mr. Bumble.  'They are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound ******* to **** 'em than to **** '**--**** is, if we can ***** 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don't die upon the road to ***** us.  Ha! ha! ha!' 

When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again *********** the cocked hat; and he became grave. 

'We are ********** business, ma'am,' said the beadle; 'here is your porochial ******* for the *****.' 

Mr. Bumble ******** some ****** money ****** up in paper, from his ******-****; and ********* a *******:  which Mrs. Mann *****. 

'It's very much *******, sir,' said the ****** of *******; 'but it's ****** enough, I **** say.  Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much ******* to you, I'm sure.' 

Mr. Bumble nodded, *******, in ************** of Mrs. ****'* *******; and inquired how the children were. 

'Bless their dear little ******!' said Mrs. Mann with *******, 'they're as well as can be, the *****!  Of course, except the two that died last week.  And little ****.' 

'Isn't that boy no better?' inquired Mr. Bumble. 

Mrs. Mann shook her head. 

'He's a ***-***********, *******, ***-******** porochial child that,' said Mr. Bumble *******.  'Where is he?' 

'I'll bring him to you in one minute, sir,' replied Mrs. Mann. 'Here, you ****!' 

After some *******, **** was **********.  Having had his face put under the ****, and ***** upon Mrs. ****'* ****, he was led into the ***** presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle. 

The child was pale and ****; his ****** were ******; and his eyes large and bright.  The ****** parish *****, the ****** of his misery, hung ******* on his ****** body; and his young ***** had ****** away, like those of an old man. 

Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's glance; not ****** to **** his eyes from the floor; and ******** even to hear the ******'* voice. 

'Can't you look at the gentleman, you ********* boy?' said Mrs. Mann. 

The child ****** raised his eyes, and *********** those of Mr. Bumble. 

'What's the matter with you, porochial ****?' inquired Mr. Bumble, with ****-***** **********. 

'Nothing, sir,' replied the child *******. 

'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble's ******. 

'You want for nothing, I'm sure.' 

'I should like--' ******** the child. 

'***-***!' interposed Mr. Mann, 'I suppose you're going to say that you DO want for something, now?  Why, you little ******--' 

'Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!' said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of *********.  'Like what, sir, eh?' 

'I should like,' ******** the child, 'if somebody that can *****, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and **** it up and **** it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.' 

'Why, what does the boy mean?' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and *** ****** of the child had made some **********: ********** as he was to such things.  'What do you mean, sir?' 

'I should like,' said the child, 'to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his ********* about in the dark ****** with nobody to help him.  And I should like to tell him,' said the child ******** his small hands together, and speaking with great *******, 'that I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had ***** to be a man, and had ***** old, my little ****** who is in Heaven, might ****** me, or be ****** me; and it would be so much ******* if we were both children there together.' 

Mr. Bumble ******** the little *******, from head to foot, with ************* astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, 'They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.  That ***-******* Oliver had *********** them all!' 

'I couldn't have ******** it, sir' said Mrs Mann, ******* up her hands, and looking *********** at ****.  'I never see such a ******** little 



'Take him away, ma'am!' said Mr. Bumble ***********.  'This must be ****** to the board, Mrs. Mann. 

'I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my *****, sir?' said Mrs. Mann, ********** ************. 

'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be ********** with the true state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble.  'There; take him away, I can't bear the sight on him.' 

**** was immediately taken away, and locked up in the ****-******.  Mr. Bumble ******* afterwards took himself off, to ******* for his *******. 

At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having ********* his cocked hat for a round one, and ******* his person in a **** *****-**** with a **** to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the ********* whose ********** was ********; with whom, in *** course of time, he arrived in London. 

He *********** no other ******* on the way, than those which ********** in the ******** ********* of the two paupers, who ********* in *********, and *********** of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble ********, ****** his teeth to ******* in his head, and made him feel quite *************; although he had a *****-**** on. 

Having disposed of these ****-****** ******* for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a ********* ****** of ******, ****** *****, and ******. Putting a glass of *** ***-***-***** on the *******-*****, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with ****** ***** *********** on the ***-********* *** of ********** and ***********, ******** himself to read the paper. 

The very first ********* upon which Mr. Bumble's eye ******, was the following *************. 

                 'FIVE ******* ****** 

'******* a young boy, ***** Oliver Twist, *********, or was *******, on ******** evening last, from his home, at ***********; and has not since been heard of.  The above ****** will be **** to any person who will give such *********** as will **** to the ********* of the said Oliver Twist, or **** to ***** any light upon his previous history, in which the ********** is, for many *******, ****** **********.' 

And then followed a full *********** of Oliver's *****, person, appearance, and *************:  with the name and ******* of Mr. Brownlow at full length. 

Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the *************, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to ***********: having ********, in his **********, left the glass of *** ***-***-*****, ********. 

'Is Mr. Brownlow at home?' inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door. 

To this inquiry the girl returned the not ********, but rather ******* reply of 'I don't know; where do you come from?' 

Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in *********** of his ******, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been ********* at the parlour door, ******** into the passage in a ********** state. 

'Come in, come in,' said the old lady: 'I knew we should hear of him. Poor dear!  I knew we should!  I was certain of it.  Bless his heart! I said so all along.' 

Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and ******* herself on a ****, burst into tears. The girl, who was not quite so ***********, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a ******* that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did. 

He was ***** into the little back *****, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with ********* and ******* before them.  The latter gentleman at once burst into the ***********: 

'A beadle.  A parish beadle, or I'll eat my head.' 

'Pray don't ********* just now,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'Take a seat, will 



Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite ********** by the ****** of Mr. *******'* manner.  Mr. Brownlow moved the ****, so as to ****** an ************* view of the ******'* countenance; and said, with a little 



'Now, sir, you come in *********** of having seen the *************?' 

'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Bumble. 

'And you ARE a beadle, are you not?' inquired Mr. Grimwig. 

'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,' rejoined Mr. Bumble *******. 

'Of course,' observed Mr. Grimwig ***** to his friend, 'I knew he was. A beadle all over!' 

Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to ****** silence on his friend, and 



'Do you know where this poor boy is now?' 

'No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble. 

'Well, what DO you know of him?' inquired the old gentleman. 'Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.  What DO you know of him?' 

'You don't ****** to know any good of him, do you?' said Mr. Grimwig, ***********; after an ********* ******* of Mr. Bumble's features. 

Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with ********** *********. 

'You see?' said Mr. Grimwig, looking ************ at Mr. Brownlow. 

Mr. Brownlow looked ************** at Mr. Bumble's ******-** countenance; and ********* him to *********** what he knew ********* Oliver, in as few words as possible. 

Mr. Bumble put down his hat; ********** his coat; ****** his arms; ******** his head in a ************* manner; and, after a few moments' **********, ********* his story. 

It would be ******* if given in the ******'* words:  *********, as it did, some twenty minutes in the *******; but the *** and ********* of it was, that Oliver was a *********, born of low and ******* *******. That he had, from his birth, ********* no better ********* than *********, ***********, and ******.  That he had ********** his brief ****** in the place of his birth, by making a ********** and ******** ****** on an *********** lad, and running away in the *****-**** from his ******'* house.  In proof of his really being the person he *********** himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the ****** he had brought to town. ******* his arms again, he then ******* Mr. ********'* 



'I fear it is all too true,' said the old gentleman ***********, after looking over the ******.  'This is not much for your intelligence; but I would ****** have given you ****** the money, if it had been ********** to the boy.' 

It is not ********** that if Mr. Bumble had been ********* of this *********** at an ******* ****** of the *********, he might have ******** a very different ********* to his little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head *******, and, ********* the five *******, ********. 

Mr. Brownlow ***** the room to and fro for some minutes; ********* so much ********* by the ******'* ****, that even Mr. Grimwig ******* to *** him further. 

At length he stopped, and **** the bell *********. 

'Mrs. Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the *********** appeared; 'that boy, Oliver, is an ********.' 

'It can't be, sir.  It cannot be,' said the old lady *************. 

'I tell you he is,' retorted the old gentleman.  'What do you mean by can't be?  We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a ********-***** little *******, all his life.' 

'I never will believe it, sir,' replied the old lady, firmly. 'Never!' 

'You old women never believe anything but *****-*******, and lying *****-*****,' growled Mr. Grimwig.  'I knew it all along. Why didn't you take my ****** in the *********; you would if he ****'* had a fever, I suppose, eh?  He was ***********, wasn't he?  ***********! ***!'  And Mr. Grimwig ***** the fire with a ********. 

'He was a dear, ********, gentle child, sir,' retorted Mrs. Bedwin, ***********.  'I know what children are, sir; and have done these ***** years; and people who can't say the same, *******'* say anything about them.  That's my opinion!' 

This was a hard *** at Mr. Grimwig, who was a ********.  As it ******** nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady ****** her head, and ******** down her ***** *********** to another ******, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow. 

'Silence!' said the old gentleman, ******** an ***** he was far from feeling.  'Never let me hear the boy's name again.  I **** to tell you that.  Never.  Never, on any ********, mind!  You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin.  ********!  I am in earnest.' 

There were *** ****** at Mr. ********'* that night. 

Oliver's heart **** within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken ********. 





CHAPTER ***** 

HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE ********* SOCIETY OF HIS ********* 



About **** next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to ****** their ********* **********, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of ******* Oliver a long ******* on the ****** *** of ***********; of which he ******* ************ he had been ******, to no ******** ******, in ******** ********* himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in ************ to ****** from them after so much trouble and ******* had been ******** in his ********. Mr. Fagin laid great ****** on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and ********* him, when, without his ****** ***, he might have ******** with ******; and he ******* the ****** and ********* history of a young lad whom, in his ************, he had ********* under ******** circumstances, but who, ******* ******** of his ********** and ******** a ****** to *********** with the ******, had ************* come to be ****** at the Old ****** one morning.  Mr. Fagin did not **** to ******* his ***** in the ***********, but ******** with tears in his eyes that the *****-****** and *********** ********* of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the ****** of certain ******** for the *****: which, if it were not ********* true, was ************* necessary for the ****** of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few ****** friends.  Mr. Fagin ********* by drawing a rather ************ ******* of the *********** of *******; and, with great ************ and ********** of manner, ********* his anxious ***** that he might never be ******* to ****** Oliver Twist to that ********** *********. 

Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words, and *********** ************ the dark ******* ******** in them.  That it was possible even for justice itself to ******** the ******** with the ****** when they were in ********** *************, he knew already; and that ******-**** ***** for the *********** of ************** knowing or ****-************* *******, had been really ******* and carried out by the Jew on more ********* than one, he thought by no means ********, when he *********** the ******* nature of the ************ between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear ********* to some ******** ********** of the kind.  As he ******* ******* up, and *** the Jew's ********* look, he felt that his pale face and trembling ***** were neither ********* nor ********** by that **** old gentleman. 

The Jew, smiling *********, ****** Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and ******* himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet.  Then, taking his hat, and ******** himself with an old ******* *****-****, he went out, and locked the ****-**** behind him. 

And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the ******* part of many ********** days, seeing nobody, between early morning and ********, and left during the long hours to ******* with his own thoughts.  Which, never ******* to ****** to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have ****** of him, were *** indeed. 

After the ***** of a week or so, the Jew left the ****-**** ********; and he was at ******* to ****** about the house. 

It was a very dirty place.  The ***** upstairs had great high ****** *******-****** and large *****, with ******** walls and ******** to the *******; which, although they were black with ******* and ****, were ********** in various ****.  From all of these ****** Oliver ********* that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had ******** to better people, and had perhaps been quite *** and ********:  ****** and ****** as it looked now. 

******* had ***** their **** in the ****** of the walls and ********; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the **** would ******* across the floor, and run back ********* to their *****.  With these **********, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was ***** of ********* from room to room, he would ****** in the corner of the passage by the ******-****, to be as near living people as he could; and would ****** there, ********* and ******** the hours, until the Jew or the boys 



In all the *****, the ********** ******** were fast closed:  the **** which held them were ******* ***** into the ****; the only light which was ********, ******** its way through round ***** at the top: which made the ***** more gloomy, and filled them with strange *******. There was a ****-****** window with ***** **** outside, which had no *******; and out of this, Oliver often ***** with a ********** face for hours together; but nothing was to be ******** from it but a ******** and crowded **** of *********, ********* ********, and *****-****. Sometimes, indeed, a ******* head might be seen, ******* over the *******-**** of a ******* house; but it was quickly ********* again; and as the window of Oliver's *********** was ****** down, and ****** with the rain and ***** of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the ***** of the different ******* beyond, without making any ******* to be seen or *****,--***** he had as much ****** of being, as if he had ***** inside the **** of **. ****'* *********. 

One *********, the Dodger and Master Bates being ******* out that evening, the *****-***** young gentleman took it into his head to ****** some ******* ********* the ********** of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an ******** ******** with him); and, with this end and ***, he *************** ********* Oliver to ****** him in his ******, ***********. 

Oliver was but too glad to make himself ******; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too ******** to ********** those about him when he could ******** do so; to ***** any ********* in the way of this ********.  So he at once ********* his *********; and, ******** on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his ****, he ******* himself to a ******* which Mr. Dawkins ********** as '********* his *******-*****.'  The ******, rendered into ***** *******, **********, ******** his *****. 

Whether it was the sense of ******* and ************ which a ******** ****** may be supposed to feel when he **** on a table in an **** attitude ******* a ****, ******** one *** ********** to and fro, and having his ***** ******* all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the *********** misery of putting them on, to ******* his ***********; or whether it was the goodness of the ******* that ******* the feelings of the Dodger, or the ******** of the **** that ********* his thoughts; he was ********* *********, for the *****, with a ***** of ******* and **********, ******* to his ******* nature. He looked down on Oliver, with a ********** countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and ******* a gentle ****, said, half in ***********, and half to Master Bates: 

'What a pity it is he isn't a ****!' 

'Ah!' said Master ******* Bates; 'he don't know what's good for him.' 

The Dodger ****** again, and resumed his ****: as did Charley Bates. They both ******, for some *******, in silence. 

'I suppose you don't even know what a **** is?' said the Dodger 



'I think I know that,' replied Oliver, looking up.  'It's a the--; you're one, are you not?' inquired Oliver, ******** himself. 

'I am,' replied the Dodger.  'I'd ***** to be anything else.'  Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ********* ****, after ********** this *********, and looked at Master Bates, as if to ****** that he would feel ******* by his saying anything to the ********. 

'I am,' repeated the Dodger.  '**'* Charley.  **'* Fagin. **'* Sikes. **'* Nancy.  **'* ***.  So we all are, down to the dog. And he's the ******** one of the ***!' 

'And the least given to ********,' added Charley Bates. 

'He wouldn't so much as **** in a *******-***, for fear of ********** himself; no, not if you **** him up in one, and left him there without ******* for a *********,' said the Dodger. 

'Not a bit of it,' observed Charley. 

'He's a *** dog.  Don't he look ****** at any strange **** that ****** or ***** when he's in company!' pursued the Dodger. 'Won't he ***** at all, when he ***** a ****** *******!  And don't he **** other dogs as ain't of his *****!  Oh, no!' 

'He's an ***-***-*** *********,' said Charley. 

This was merely ******** as a ******* to the ******'* *********, but it was an *********** remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, ******** to be ***-***-*** **********, between whom, and Mr. Sikes' dog, there ***** strong and ******** ****** of ***********. 

'Well, well,' said the Dodger, ********* to the point from which they had *******: with that *********** of his ********** which ********** all his ***********.  'This ****'* go anything to do with young Green 



'No more it has,' said Charley.  'Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?' 

'And make your ******' out of hand?' added the Dodger, with a grin. 

'And so be able to ****** on your ********, and do the ***-****: as I mean to, in the very next ****-**** but four that ever comes, and the *****-****** ******* in *******-****,' said Charley Bates. 

'I don't like it,' rejoined Oliver, *******; 'I wish they would let me go.  *--*--***** rather go.' 

'And Fagin would RATHER not!' rejoined Charley. 

Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be ********* to ******* his feelings more ******, he only ******, and went on with his 



'Go!' exclaimed the Dodger.  'Why, *****'* your ******?' Don't you take any ***** out of yourself?  Would you go and be ********* on your 



'Oh, blow that!' said Master Bates: drawing two or three **** ************* from his pocket, and ******* them into a ********, 'that's too mean; that is.' 

'_I_ couldn't do it,' said the Dodger, with an air of ******* *******. 

'You can leave your friends, though,' said Oliver with a half smile; 'and let them be ******** for what you did.' 

'That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a **** of his ****, 'That was all out of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the ***** know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we ****'* made our *****; that was the ****, wasn't it, Charley?' 

Master Bates nodded ******, and would have spoken, but the ************ of Oliver's ****** came so suddenly upon him, that the ***** he was ******** got ********* with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of ******** and ********, about five minutes long. 

'Look here!' said the Dodger, drawing forth a ******* of ********* and *********. 'Here's a ***** life!  What's the **** where it comes from? Here, ***** hold; there's ****** more where they were took from.  You won't, won't you?  Oh, you ******** ****!' 

'It's *******, ain't it, Oliver?' inquired Charley Bates. 'He'll come to be ********, won't he?' 

'I don't know what that means,' replied Oliver. 

'Something in this way, old ******,' said ******.  As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his ***********; and, ******* it ***** in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and ****** a ******* sound through his teeth; ******* **********, by a ****** ********** **************, that ********* and ******* were one and the same thing. 

'That's what it means,' said Charley.  'Look how he ******, ****! 

I never did see such ***** company as that '*** boy; he'll be the death of me, I know he will.'  Master Charley Bates, having laughed ******** again, resumed his **** with tears in his eyes. 

'You've been brought up bad,' said the Dodger, ********* his ***** with much satisfaction when Oliver had ******** them. 'Fagin will make something of you, though, or you'll be the first he ever had that turned out ************.  ***'* better ***** at once; for you'll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you're only ****** time, 



Master Bates ****** this ****** with ****** ***** *********** of his own:  which, being *********, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins ******** into a ******* *********** of the ******** ********* ********** to the life they led, ************ with a ******* of ***** to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to ****** *****'* ****** without more *****, by the means which they themselves had ******** to **** it. 

'And always put this in your ****, *****,' said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard ********* the door above, 'if you don't take ****** and 



'What's the good of talking in that way?' interposed Master Bates; 'he don't know what you mean.' 

'If you don't take ******-*********** and *******,' said the Dodger, ******** his conversation to the ***** of Oliver's ********, 'some other **** will; so that the ***** that lose 'em will be all the worse, and you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a **'*'**** the better, except the ***** wot **** ****--*** you've just as good a right to them as they have.' 

'To be sure, to be sure!' said the Jew, who had entered ****** by Oliver.  'It all **** in a ******** my dear; in a ********, take the ******'* word for it.  Ha! ha! ha!  He *********** the ********* of his 



The old man ****** his hands ********* together, as he ************ the ******'* ********* in these *****; and ******** with ******* at his *****'* ***********. 

The conversation proceeded no ******* at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss *****, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was ******** by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having ******** on the stairs to ******** a few *********** with the lady, now made his appearance. 

Mr. Chitling was ***** in years than the Dodger: having perhaps ******** ******** *******; but there was a ****** of ********* in his ********** towards that young gentleman which seemed to ******** that he felt himself ********* of a slight *********** in point of ****** and ************ ***********.  He had small ********* eyes, and a ****-****** face; **** a *** ***, a dark ******** ******, ****** ******* ********, and an *****.  His ******** was, in truth, rather out of ******; but he ******* himself to the company by ******* that his 'time' was only out an hour before; and that, in *********** of having **** the *********** for six ***** past, he had not been able to ****** any attention on his ******* clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with strong ***** of **********, that the new way of ********** clothes up ****** was ******** ****************, for it ***** ***** in them, and there was no ****** against the ******.  The same remark he considered to ***** to the ********** **** of ******* the hair: which he held to be ********* ********.  Mr. Chitling ***** up his ************ by ******* that he had not ******* a drop of anything for *****-*** ***** long ****-******* days; and that he '****** he might be ****** if he ****'* as *** as a ****-******.' 

'Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?' inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a ****** of spirits on the 



'*--*--***'* know, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'***'* that?' inquired Tom Chitling, ******* a ************ look at 



'A young friend of mine, my dear,' replied the Jew. 

'He's in ****, then,' said the young man, with a ******* look at Fagin. 'Never mind where I came from, young '**; you'll find your way there, soon enough, I'll *** a *****!' 

At this *****, the boys laughed.  After some more ***** on the same subject, they ********* a few short ******** with Fagin; and ********. 

After some words ***** between the last ***** and Fagin, they drew their ****** towards the fire; and the Jew, ******* Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the ****** most ********** to interest his *******.  These were, the great ********** of the trade, the *********** of the Dodger, the ********** of Charley Bates, and the ********** of the Jew himself.  At length these ******** ********* ***** of being ********** *********; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of ********** ******* ********* after a week or two. Miss ***** *********** ********; and left the party to their ******. 

From this day, Oliver was ****** left alone; but was placed in almost ******** ************* with the two boys, who ****** the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own *********** or Oliver's, Mr. Fagin best knew.  At other times the old man would tell them ******* of ********* he had ********* in his ******* days:  ***** up with so much that was ***** and *******, that Oliver could not help ******** ********, and ******* that he was ****** in ***** of all his better 



In short, the **** old Jew had the boy in his *****.  Having ******** his mind, by ******** and *****, to ****** any society to the ************* of his own *** thoughts in such a ****** place, he was now slowly ********** into his soul the ****** which he ***** would ******* it, and change its *** for ever. 





CHAPTER *** 

IN WHICH A ******* **** IS ********* AND DETERMINED ON 

It was a *****, ****, ***** night, when the Jew: ********* his *****-**** ***** round his ********** body, and ******* the ****** up over his ears so as ********** to ******* the lower part of his face: ******* from his ***.  He paused on the step as the door was locked and ******* behind him; and having listened while the boys made all ******, and until their ********** ********* were no longer *******, ***** down the street as quickly as he could. 

The house to which Oliver had been ********, was in the ************ of ***********.  The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing ************ round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the ************. 

The *** lay thick upon the ******, and a black **** hung over the streets; the rain fell ********** down, and everything felt cold and ****** to the *****.  It seemed just the night when it ******** such a being as the Jew to be ******.  As he ****** ********** along, ******** beneath the ******* of the walls and ********, the ******* old man seemed like some ********* *******, ********** in the ***** and darkness through which he moved: ******** forth, by night, in ****** of some **** ***** for a ****. 

He kept on his course, through many ******* and narrow ****, until he reached ******* Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became ******** in a **** of the mean and dirty streets which ****** in that close and *******-********* quarter. 

The Jew was ********* too ******** with the ground he ********* to be at all **********, either by the darkness of the night, or the *********** of the way.  He hurried through several ****** and streets, and at length turned into one, ******* only by a ****** **** at the ******* end.  At the door of a house in this street, he *******; having ********* a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked 



A dog growled as he ******* the ****** of a ****-****; and a man's voice demanded who was there. 

'Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,' said the Jew looking in. 

'Bring in your body then,' said Sikes.  'Lie down, you ****** *****! Don't you know the devil when he's got a *****-**** on?' 

Apparently, the dog had been ******** ******** by Mr. *****'* ***** *******; for as the Jew ********** it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he ******* to the corner from which he had *****:  ******* his **** as he went, to show that he was as well ********* as it was in his nature to be. 

'Well!' said Sikes. 

'Well, my dear,' replied the ***.--'**! Nancy.' 

The latter *********** was uttered with just enough of ************* to ***** a doubt of its *********; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not ***, since she had ********** in ****** of Oliver.  All ****** upon the subject, if he had any, were ******** ******* by the young ****'* *********.  She took her feet off the ******, ****** back her chair, and **** Fagin **** up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a cold night, and no *******. 

'It is cold, Nancy dear,' said the Jew, as he ****** his ****** hands over the fire.  'It ***** to go right through one,' added the old man, ******** his side. 

'It must be a *******, if it ***** its way through your heart,' said Mr. Sikes.  'Give him something to drink, Nancy.  **** my body, make *****!  It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his **** old ******* ********* in that way, like a **** ***** just rose from the grave.' 

Nancy quickly brought a ****** from a ********, in which there were many:  which, to ***** from the ********* of their appearance, were filled with several ***** of *******.  Sikes ******* out a glass of ******, **** the Jew drink it off. 

'Quite enough, quite, *******, Bill,' replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just ******* his lips to it. 

'What!  You're afraid of our ******* the better of you, are you?' inquired Sikes, ****** his eyes on the Jew.  '***!' 

With a ****** ***** of ********, Mr. Sikes ****** the glass, and threw the ********* of its ******** into the *****: as a *********** ******** to ******* it again for himself:  which he did at once. 

The Jew ******* round the room, as his companion ****** down the second ********; not in **********, for he had seen it often before; but in a ******** and ********** manner ******** to him. It was a ****** ********* *********, with nothing but the ******** of the ****** to ****** the ****** that its ******** was anything but a ******* man; and with no more ********** ******** ********* to view than two or three heavy ********* which stood in a corner, and a '****-*********' that hung over the *******-*****. 

'There,' said Sikes, ******** his lips. 'Now I'm ready.' 

'For business?' inquired the Jew. 

'For business,' replied Sikes; 'so say what you've got to say.' 

'About the **** at ********, Bill?' said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice. 

'Yes.  Wot about it?' inquired Sikes. 

'Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,' said the Jew.  'He knows what I mean, Nancy; don't he?' 

'No, he don't,' ******* Mr. Sikes.  'Or he won't, and that's the same thing.  Speak out, and call things by their right *****; don't sit there, ******* and ********, and talking to me in *****, as if you ****'* the very first that thought about the robbery.  Wot *'** mean?' 

'Hush, Bill, hush!' said the Jew, who had in **** ********* to stop this burst of ***********; 'somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear us.' 

'Let 'em hear!' said Sikes; 'I don't care.'  But as Mr. Sikes DID care, on **********, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew 



'There, there,' said the Jew, *********.  'It was only my *******, nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that **** at ********; when is it to be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be done?  Such *****, my dear, such *****!' said the Jew:  ******* his hands, and ********* his ******** in a ******* of ************. 

'Not at all,' replied Sikes ******. 

'Not to be done at all!' ****** the Jew, ******* back in his chair. 

'No, not at all,' rejoined Sikes.  'At least it can't be a ***-** ***, as we expected.' 

'Then it ****'* been ******** gone about,' said the Jew, turning pale with *****.  'Don't tell me!' 

'But I will tell you,' retorted Sikes.  'Who are you that's not to be told?  I tell you that Toby Crackit has been ******* about the place for a *********, and he can't get one of the ******** in ****.' 

'Do you mean to tell me, Bill,' said the Jew: ********* as the other grew ******:  'that neither of the two men in the house can be got 



'Yes, I do mean to tell you so,' replied Sikes.  'The old lady has had 'em these twenty years; and if you were to give 'em five ******* pound, they wouldn't be in it.' 

'But do you mean to say, my dear,' ************ the Jew, 'that the women can't be got over?' 

'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes. 

'Not by ***** Toby Crackit?' said the Jew *************. 'Think what women are, Bill,' 

'No; not even by ***** Toby Crackit,' replied Sikes.  'He says he's **** **** ********, and a ****** waistcoat, the whole ******* time he's been ********* down there, and it's all of no use.' 

'He should have tried ********** and a pair of ******** ********, my dear,' said the Jew. 

'So he did,' rejoined Sikes, 'and they ****'* of no more use than the other *****.' 

The Jew looked ***** at this ***********.  After ********** for some minutes with his **** **** on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep ****, that if ***** Toby Crackit ******** ******, he ****** the game was up. 

'And yet,' said the old man, ******** his hands on his knees, 'it's a *** thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our ****** upon it.' 

'So it is,' said Mr. Sikes.  'Worse ****!' 

A long silence ******; during which the Jew was ******* in deep thought, with his face ******** into an expression of ******** perfectly **********.  Sikes **** him ********* from time to time. Nancy, apparently ******* of ********** the ************, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been **** to all that passed. 

'Fagin,' said Sikes, ******** ******** the ********* that *********; 'is it worth ***** ******* *****, if it's ****** done from the outside?' 

'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly ******* himself. 

'Is it a *******?' inquired Sikes. 

'Yes, my dear, yes,' rejoined the Jew; his eyes **********, and every ****** in his face *******, with the ********** that the inquiry had 



'Then,' said Sikes, ********* ***** the Jew's hand, with some *******, 'let it come off as soon as you like.  Toby and me were over the ******-**** the night afore last, ******** the ****** of the door and ********.  The ****'* ****** up at night like a ****; but there's one part we can *****, safe and softly.' 

'Which is that, Bill?' asked the Jew eagerly. 

'Why,' whispered Sikes, 'as you ***** the ****--' 

'Yes?' said the Jew, ******* his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it. 

'****!' cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely ****** her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's face.  'Never mind which part it is. You can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one ***** with you.' 

'As you like, my dear, as you like' replied the Jew.  'Is there no help wanted, but ***** and ****'*?' 

'None,' said Sikes.  '**** a ******-*** and a boy.  The first **'** both got; the second you must find us.' 

'A boy!' exclaimed the Jew.  'Oh! then it's a *****, eh?' 

'Never mind wot it is!' replied Sikes.  'I want a boy, and he ****'* be a *** '**.  ****!' said Mr. Sikes, ************, 'if I'd only got that young boy of ***, the ********-*******'*!  He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the ***.  But the father **** ******; and then the ******** ********** Society comes, and ***** the boy away from a trade where he was ******* money, ******* him to read and *****, and in time ***** a '******** of him.  And so they go on,' said Mr. Sikes, his ***** rising with the ************ of his ******, 'so they go on; and, if ****'* got money enough (which it's a ********** they haven't,) we *******'* have half a ***** boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.' 

'No more we should,' ********** the Jew, who had been *********** during this ******, and had only caught the last ********. 'Bill!' 

'What now?' inquired Sikes. 

The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still ****** at the fire; and *********, by a ****, that he would have her told to leave the room.  Sikes ******** his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the ********** ***********; but ********, ************, by ********** Miss Nancy to ***** him a *** of ****. 

'You don't want any ****,' said Nancy, ******* her arms, and ********* her seat very **********. 

'I tell you I do!' replied Sikes. 

'********,' rejoined the girl ******, 'Go on, Fagin.  I know what he's going to say, Bill; he *****'* mind me.' 

The Jew still *********.  Sikes looked from one to the other in some 



'Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?' he asked at length. 'You've known her long enough to ***** her, or the *****'* in it.  She ain't one to ****.  Are you Nancy?' 

'_I_ should think not!' replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her ****** upon it. 

'No, no, my dear, I know you're not,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again the old man paused. 

'But wot?' inquired Sikes. 

'I didn't know whether she ******'* *'*'*** be out of *****, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,' replied the Jew. 

At this **********, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, ********** a glass of ******, shook her head with an air of ********, and burst into ****** ************ of 'Keep the game *-*****!'  'Never say die!' and the like.  These seemed to have the effect of **-******** both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a ********* air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes ********. 

'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh.  'Tell Bill at once, about 



'Ha! you're a ****** one, my dear: the ******** girl I ever saw!' said the Jew, ******* her on the neck.  'It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!' 

'What about him?' demanded Sikes. 

'He's the boy for you, my dear,' replied the Jew in a ****** whisper; laying his ****** on the side of his nose, and ******** ***********. 

'He!' exclaimed. Sikes. 

'Have him, Bill!' said Nancy.  'I would, if I was in your place. He ****'* be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you want, if he's only to open a door for you.  ****** upon it he's a safe one, Bill.' 

'I know he is,' rejoined Fagin.  'He's been in good ******** these last few *****, and it's time he began to work for his bread.  Besides, the others are all too ***.' 

'Well, he is just the **** I want,' said Mr. Sikes, **********. 

'And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,' interposed the Jew; 'he can't help himself.  That is, if you ******** him enough.' 

'******** him!' ****** Sikes.  '**'** be no **** ***********, mind you. If there's anything ***** about him when we once get into the work; in for a *****, in for a pound.  You won't see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him.  **** my words!' said the robber, ******* a *******, which he had drawn from under the ********. 

'I've thought of it all,' said the Jew with ******. '*'**--*'** had my eye upon him, my *****, *****--*****. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once **** his mind with the **** that he has been a thief; and he's ****!  **** for his life.  ***!  It couldn't have come about better!  The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a ****, ********* ****** himself for joy. 

'****!' said Sikes.  '*****, you mean.' 

'Perhaps I do, my dear,' said the Jew, with a ****** *******. 'Mine, if you like, Bill.' 

'And wot,' said Sikes, ******** ******** on his ********* friend, 'wot ***** you take so much ***** about one *****-***** ***, when you know there are ***** boys ******** about Common ****** every night, as you might **** and ****** from?' 

'Because they're of no use to me, my dear,' replied the Jew, with some *********, 'not worth the taking.  Their looks ******* 'em when they get into trouble, and I lose 'em all.  With this boy, ******** *******, my *****, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them.  Besides,' said the Jew, ********** his ****-**********, 'he has us now if he could only give us ***-**** again; and he must be in the same **** with us.  Never mind how he came there; it's quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that's all I want.  Now, how much better this is, than being ******* to put the poor ****** boy out of the ***--***** would be *********, and we should lose by it besides.' 

'When is it to be done?' asked Nancy, stopping some ********* *********** on the part of Mr. Sikes, ********** of the ******* with which he received *****'* *********** of ********. 

'Ah, to be sure,' said the Jew; 'when is it to be done, Bill?' 

'I ******* with Toby, the night ***** to-morrow,' rejoined Sikes in a ***** voice, 'if he ***** nothing from me to the *********.' 

'Good,' said the Jew; 'there's no ****.' 

'No,' rejoined Sikes. 

'It's all ******** about ******** off the ****, is it?' asked the Jew. 

Sikes nodded. 

'And about--' 

'Oh, ah, it's all *******,' rejoined Sikes, ************ him. 'Never mind ***********.  ***'* better bring the boy here to-morrow night.  I shall get off the stone an hour ***** ********.  Then you hold your ******, and keep the *******-*** ready, and that's all you'll have to 



After some **********, in which all three took an ****** part, it was ******* that Nancy should ****** to the Jew's next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin ******** *********, that, if he ******* any ************** to the ****, he would be more ******* to ********* the girl who had so ******** ********** in his ******, than anybody else.  It was also ******** ******** that poor Oliver should, for the ******** of the ************ **********, be ************ ********* to the care and ******* of Mr. ******* Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held *********** by the Jew for any ********* or **** that might be necessary to ***** him: it being ********** that, to ****** the ******* in this ******* *******, any *************** made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be ******** to be ********* and ************, in all ********* ***********, by the ********* of ***** Toby Crackit. 

These ************* ********, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink ****** at a ******* ****, and to ******** the ******* in an ******** manner; ******* forth, at the same time, most ********* ******** of ****, ******* with **** ***********.  At length, in a fit of ************ **********, he ******** upon ********* his box of ************* *****: which he had no sooner ******** in with, and opened for the purpose of ********** the nature and ********** of the various ********** it *********, and the ******** ******** of their ************, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell. 

'****-*****, Nancy,' said the Jew, ******** himself up as before. 





Their eyes ***, and the Jew *********** her, ********.  There was no ********* about the girl.  She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be. 

The Jew again **** her ****-*****, and, ********* a *** **** upon the ********* form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, ****** 



'Always the way!' muttered the Jew to himself as he turned ********. 'The ***** of these women is, that a very little thing ****** to call up some ****-********* feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never *****.  Ha! ha!  The man against the child, for a *** of gold!' 

********* the time with these pleasant ***********, Mr. Fagin ****** his way, through *** and ****, to his gloomy *****:  where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently ******** his return. 

'Is Oliver *-***?  I want to speak to him,' was his first remark as they ********* the stairs. 

'Hours ago,' replied the Dodger, ******** open a door.  'Here he is!' 

The boy was lying, fast ******, on a **** bed upon the floor; so pale with *******, and *******, and the ********* of his ******, that he looked like death; not death as it ***** in ****** and coffin, but in the ***** it ***** when life has just ********; when a young and gentle ****** has, but an instant, **** to Heaven, and the ***** air of the world has not had time to ******* upon the ******** **** it ********. 

'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away.  'To-morrow. To-morrow.' 





CHAPTER ** 

******* OLIVER IS ********* OVER TO MR. ******* SIKES 

When Oliver ***** in the morning, he was a good deal ********* to find that a new pair of *****, with strong thick *****, had been placed at his *******; and that his old ***** had been *******. At first, he was ******* with the *********: ****** that it might be the ********** of his *******; but such thoughts were quickly *********, on his sitting down to ********* along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which ********* his alarm, that he was to be taken to the ********* of Bill Sikes that night. 

'**--**--**** there, sir?' asked Oliver, *********. 

'No, no, my dear.  Not to stop there,' replied the Jew.  'We *******'* like to lose you.  Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won't be so ***** as to send you away, my dear. Oh no, no!' 

The old man, who was ******** over the fire ******** a piece of bread, looked round as he ******** Oliver thus; and ******** as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could. 

'I suppose,' said the Jew, ****** his eyes on Oliver, 'you want to know what you're going to ****'* ***---**, my dear?' 

Oliver ********, *************, to find that the old thief had been ******* his thoughts; but ****** said, Yes, he did want to know. 

'Why, do you think?' inquired Fagin, ******** the question. 

'Indeed I don't know, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'***!' said the Jew, turning away with a ************ countenance from a close ******* of the boy's face.  '**** till Bill ***** you, then.' 

The Jew seemed much ***** by Oliver's not ********** any ******* ********* on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much ******** by the earnest ******* of *****'* looks, and his own ************, to make any further ********* just then.  He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very ***** and silent till night:  when he ******** to go ******. 

'You may **** a candle,' said the Jew, putting one upon the table. 'And here's a book for you to read, till they come to ***** you. 



'****-*****!' replied Oliver, softly. 

The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went.  Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name. 

Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, ******** him to light it.  He did so; and, as he placed the *********** upon the table, saw that the Jew was ****** ******* at him, with ******** and ********** *****, from the dark end of the room. 

'Take ****, Oliver! take ****!' said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a ******* manner.  'He's a ***** man, and ****** nothing of blood when his own is up. ******** ***** out, say nothing; and do what he **** you.  Mind!'  ******* a strong ******** on the last word, he ******** his features gradually to ******* themselves into a ******* grin, and, ******* his head, left the room. 

Oliver ****** his head upon his hand when the old man ***********, and ********, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.  The more he thought of the Jew's **********, the more he was at a loss to ****** its real purpose and *******. 

He could think of no bad object to be ******** by ******* him to Sikes, which would not be ******* well answered by his ********* with Fagin; and after ********** for a long time, ********* that he had been ******** to ******* some ******** ****** ******* for the ************, until another boy, better ****** for his purpose could be *******.  He was too well ********** to *********, and had ******** too much where he was, to ****** the ******** of change very ********.  He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy ****, ******* the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read. 

He turned over the ******.  ********** at first; but, ******** on a passage which ********* his attention, he soon became ****** upon the ******.  It was a history of the ***** and ****** of great *********; and the ***** were ****** and ******* with use. Here, he read of dreadful ****** that made the blood run cold; of secret ******* that had been ********* by the ****** *******; of ****** ****** from the eye of man in deep **** and *****: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had ******* them up at last, after many years, and so ******** the ********* with the sight, that in their ****** they had ********* their *****, and ****** for the ****** to end their *****. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their **** at dead of night, had been ******* (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful ********* as it made the ***** *****, and the ***** *****, to think of.  The ******** ************ were so real and *****, that the ****** ***** seemed to turn red with ****; and the words upon them, to be ******* in his ears, as if they were whispered, in ****** *******, by the spirits of the dead. 

In a ******** of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he ****** Heaven to ***** him from such *****; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be ******** for ******, so ******* and *********. By *******, he grew more ****, and ********, in a low and broken voice, that he might be ******* from his present *******; and that if any *** were to be raised up for a poor ******* boy who had never known the love of friends or *******, it might come to him now, when, ******** and ********, he stood alone in the ***** of ********** and *****. 

He had ********* his ******, but still remained with his head ****** in his hands, when a ******** noise ******* him. 

'What's that!' he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a ****** standing by the door.  '***'* there?' 

'Me.  Only me,' replied a ********* voice. 

Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was Nancy. 

'Put down the light,' said the girl, turning away her head. 'It ***** my eyes.' 

Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him:  and ***** her hands; but made no reply. 

'God ******* me!' she cried after a while, 'I never thought of this.' 

'Has anything happened?' asked Oliver.  'Can I help you?  I will if I can.  I will, indeed.' 

She ****** herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, ******** a ******** sound, ****** for breath. 

'Nancy!' cried Oliver, 'What is it?' 

The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her ***** close round her: and ******** with cold. 

Oliver ******* the fire.  Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round. 

'I don't know what comes over me sometimes,' said she, ********* to **** herself in ********* her *****; 'it's this **** dirty room, I think.  Now, *****, dear, are you ready?' 

'Am I to go with you?' asked Oliver. 

'Yes.  I have come from Bill,' replied the girl.  'You are to go with 



'What for?' asked Oliver, *********. 

'What for?' ****** the girl, raising her eyes, and ******** them again, the moment they *********** the boy's face.  'Oh!  For no ****.' 

'I don't believe it,' said Oliver:  who had watched her *******. 

'Have it your own way,' rejoined the girl, ********* to laugh. 'For no good, then.' 

Oliver could see that he had some power over the ****'* better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of ********* to her ********** for his ******** state.  But, then, the thought ****** across his mind that it was ****** ****** o'clock; and that many people were still in the streets:  of whom ****** some might be found to give ******** to his ****.  As the ********** ******* to him, he ******* forward:  and said, ******** hastily, that he was ready. 

Neither his brief consideration, nor its *******, was lost on his companion.  She **** him ********, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which ************ showed that she ******* what had been passing in his thoughts. 

'Hush!' said the girl, ******** over him, and pointing to the door as she looked ********** round.  'You can't help yourself. I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose.  You are ****** round and round. If ever you are to get ***** from here, this is not the time.' 

Struck by the ****** of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise.  She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and ********; and she ******** with very ***********. 

'I have ***** you from being ***-**** once, and I will again, and I do now,' continued the girl *****; 'for those who would have ******* you, if I had not, would have been far more ***** than me.  I have ******** for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do **** to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.  See here!  I have ***** all this for you already, as true as God **** me show it.' 

She pointed, hastily, to some ***** ******* on her neck and arms; and continued, with great ********: 

'******** this!  And don't let me ****** more for you, just now. If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They don't mean to **** you; ******** they make you do, is no ***** of *****.  Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me your hand.  Make *****! Your hand!' 

She caught the hand which Oliver ************* placed in ****, and, ******* out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was opened, quickly, by some one ******** in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A *******-********* was in *******; with the same ********* which she had ********* in ********** Oliver, the girl ****** him in with her, and drew the ******** close. The ****** wanted no **********, but ****** his ***** into full *****, without the ***** of an instant. 

The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to **** into his ear, the ******** and ********** she had already ********.  All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to ********* where he was, or how he came there, when the ******** stopped at the house to which the Jew's steps had been ******** on the previous evening. 

For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.  But the ****'* voice was in his ear, ********** him in such ***** of ***** to ******** her, that he had not the heart to ***** it. While he *********, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was 



'This way,' said the girl, ********* her hold for the first time. 



'*****!' replied Sikes: ********* at the head of the stairs, with a candle.  'Oh!  That's the time of day.  Come on!' 

This was a very strong expression of ***********, an ********** ****** *******, from a person of Mr. Sikes' ***********.  Nancy, ********* much ********* *******, ******* him *********. 

'****'*-***'* gone home with Tom,' observed Sikes, as he ******* them up.  'He'd have been in the way.' 

'That's right,' rejoined Nancy. 

'So you've got the ***,' said Sikes when they had all reached the room: ******* the door as he spoke. 

'Yes, here he is,' replied Nancy. 

'Did he come quiet?' inquired Sikes. 

'Like a ****,' rejoined Nancy. 

'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking ****** at Oliver; 'for the sake of his young *******:  as would ********* have ******** for it. Come here, young '**; and let me read you a ******', which is as well got over at once.' 

Thus ********** his new *****, Mr. Sikes ****** off Oliver's *** and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him. 

'Now, first:  do you know wot this is?' inquired Sikes, taking up a ******-****** which lay on the table. 

Oliver replied in the ***********. 

'Well, then, look here,' continued Sikes.  'This is ******; that '***'* a ******; and this is a little bit of a old hat for ******'.' 

Oliver ******** his ************* of the different ****** ******** to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to **** the ******, with great ****** and 



'Now it's ******,' said Mr. Sikes, when he had ********. 

'Yes, I see it is, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'Well,' said the robber, ******** Oliver's *****, and putting the ****** so close to his ****** that they *******; at which moment the boy could not ******* a *****; 'if you speak a word when you're out *'***** with me, except when I speak to you, that ******* will be in your head without notice.  So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak without leave, say your ******* first.' 

Having ******** a ***** upon the object of this *******, to ******** its effect, Mr. Sikes continued. 

'As near as I know, there isn't anybody as would be ****** very ********** ***** you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I *****'* take this *****-***-*** of trouble to ******* matters to you, if it ****'* for your own good.  *'** hear me?' 

'The short and the long of what you mean,' said Nancy:  speaking very ************, and ******** ******** at Oliver as if to ******* his ******* attention to her words:  'is, that if you're crossed by him in this *** you have on hand, you'll ******* his ever ******* ***** afterwards, by ******** him through the head, and will take your ****** of ******** for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every ***** of your life.' 

'That's it!' observed Mr. Sikes, ***********; 'women can always put things in ****** *****.--****** when it's ******* up; and then they ********* it out.  And now that he's ********** up to it, ***'* have some ******, and get a ****** before starting.' 

In ********* of this *******, Nancy quickly laid the *****; ************ for a few minutes, she ********* returned with a *** of ****** and a **** of *****'* heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant ********** on the part of Mr. Sikes, ******* upon the ******** *********** of '*******' being a can name, common to them, and also to an ********* ********* much used in his **********.  Indeed, the worthy gentleman, ********** perhaps by the ********* ******** of being on ****** *******, was in great spirits and good ******; in proof *******, it may be here ********, that he *********** ***** all the **** at a *******, and did not *****, on a ***** ***********, more than ****-***** ***** during the whole ******** of the ****. 

****** being *****--** may be ****** ********* that Oliver had no great ******** for **--**. Sikes disposed of a couple of ******* of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ******** Nancy, with many ************ in case of *******, to call him at five *********.  Oliver ********* himself in his clothes, by ******* of the same *********, on a ******** upon the floor; and the girl, ******* the fire, sat before it, in ********* to ***** them at the ********* time. 

For a long time Oliver lay *****, thinking it not ********** that Nancy might **** that opportunity of ********** some further ******; but the girl sat ******** over the fire, without ******, save now and then to **** the light.  ***** with watching and *******, he at length fell 



When he *****, the table was covered with ***-******, and Sikes was ********* various ******** into the pockets of his *****-****, which hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was ****** ******* in ********* *********.  It was not yet ********; for the candle was still *******, and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was ******* against the ******-*****; and the *** looked black and ******. 

'Now, then!' growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; '****-**** five! Look sharp, or you'll get no *********; for it's late as it is.' 

Oliver was not long in making his ******; having taken some *********, he replied to a ***** inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite 



Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to *** round his throat; Sikes gave him a large ***** **** to ****** over his shoulders.  Thus *******, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely ******* to show him with a ******** ******* that he had that same ****** in a ****-****** of his *****-****, ******* it firmly in his, and, ********** a ******** with Nancy, led him away. 

Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of ******* a look from the girl.  But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly ********** before it. 





CHAPTER *** 

THE ********** 

It was a ********* morning when they got into the street; ******* and ******* hard; and the ****** looking **** and ******.  The night had been very ***: large ***** of water had ********* in the road: and the ******* were ***********.  There was a ***** ********** of the coming day in the ***; but it rather ********** than ******** the ***** of the scene:  the ****** light only ******* to pale that which the street ***** ********, without ******** any ****** or ******** ***** upon the *** *****-****, and ****** streets.  There appeared to be nobody ******** in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all ******* shut; and the streets through which they passed, were ********* and empty. 

By the time they had turned into the ******* Green Road, the day had ****** ***** to *****.  Many of the ***** were already ************; a few country ******* were slowly ******* on, towards London; now and then, a *****-*****, covered with ***, ******* ******* by: the ****** *********, as he passed, an ********** **** upon the heavy ******** who, by ******* on the wrong side of the road, had ********** his ******** at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.  The ******-******, with ***-****** ******* inside, were already open.  By *******, other ***** began to be ********, and a few ********* people were *** with.  Then, came ********** ****** of ********* going to their work; then, men and women with ****-******* on their heads; ******-***** ***** with **********; ******-***** filled with ****-***** or whole ********* of ****; ****-***** with *****; an ******** ********* of people, ******** out with various ******** to the ******* ******* of the town.  As they ********** the ****, the noise and ******* gradually *********; when they ******** the streets between ********** and **********, it had ******* into a **** of sound and ******.  It was as light as it was ****** to be, till night came on again, and the **** morning of half the London ********** had *****. 

Turning down *** Street and ***** Street, and ******** ******** ******, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of ******** Street, into ********: ****** into Long ****, and so into **********; from which latter place ***** a ****** of ********** ****** that filled Oliver Twist with *********. 

It was ******-*******.  The ground was covered, nearly *****-****, with ***** and ****; a thick *****, *********** rising from the ******* ****** of the ******, and ******** with the ***, which seemed to rest upon the *******-****, hung ******* above.  All the **** in the ****** of the large ****, and as many ********* **** as could be crowded into the ****** space, were filled with *****; **** up to ***** by the ****** side were long ***** of ****** and ****, three or four deep. **********, ********, *******, *******, boys, *******, ******, and ********* of every low *****, were ******* together in a ****; the ********* of *******, the ******* dogs, the ********* and ******** of the ****, the ******** of *****, the ******** and ********* of ****, the ***** of *******, the ******, *****, and *********** on all *****; the ******* of ***** and **** of ******, that ****** from every public-house; the ********, *******, *******, *******, ******** and *******; the ******* and ********** *** that ********* from every corner of the ******; and the ********, ********, *******, and dirty ******* ********** running to and fro, and ******** in and out of the ******; rendered it a ******** and *********** scene, which quite ********** the ******. 

Mr. Sikes, ******** Oliver after him, ******* his way through the ******** of the crowd, and ******** very little attention on the ******** ****** and ******, which so ********** the boy.  He nodded, twice or ******, to a passing friend; and, ********* as many *********** to take a morning ****, ******* ******** ******, until they were clear of the *******, and had made their way through ****** **** into *******. 

'Now, young '**!' said Sikes, looking up at the ***** of **. ******'* Church, 'hard upon *****! you must step out.  Come, don't *** behind already, ****-****!' 

Mr. Sikes accompanied this ****** with a **** at his little companion's *****; Oliver, ********** his pace into a kind of **** between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the ***** ******* of the *****-******* as well as he could. 

They held their course at this ****, until they had passed **** **** corner, and were on their way to **********:  when Sikes ******* his pace, until an empty **** which was at some little distance behind, came up.  Seeing '********' ******* on it, he asked the ****** with as much ******** as he could ******, if he would give them a **** as far as *********. 

'**** up,' said the man.  'Is that your boy?' 

'Yes; he's my boy,' replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand ************ into the pocket where the ****** was. 

'Your father ***** rather too quick for you, don't he, my man?' inquired the ******: seeing that Oliver was out of breath. 

'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes, ***********.  'He's used to it. 

Here, take hold of my hand, ***.  In with you!' 

Thus ********** Oliver, he ****** him into the ****; and the ******, pointing to a **** of *****, told him to lie down there, and rest 



As they passed the different ****-******, Oliver ********, more and more, where his companion ***** to take him.  **********, ***********, ********, *** Bridge, *********, were all passed; and yet they went on as ******** as if they had only just ***** their *******.  At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and ******; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.  And here, the **** 



Sikes ********** with great *************, ******* Oliver by the hand all the while; and ******* him down directly, ******** a ******* look upon him, and ****** the ****-****** with his ****, in a *********** 



'****-***, boy,' said the man. 

'He's *****,' replied Sikes, giving him a *****; 'he's *****.  A young dog!  Don't mind him.' 

'Not I!' rejoined the other, ******* into his ****.  'It's a fine day, after all.'  And he ***** away. 

Sikes ****** until he had ****** gone; and then, ******* Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him ****** on his 



They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a *****-**** road, walked on for a long time: passing many large ******* and *********'* houses on both ***** of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little ****, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw ******* up in pretty large *******, '*******.'  They ******** about, in the fields, for some hours.  At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a ******* ****-*****, ******* some ****** by the kitchen fire. 

The kitchen was an old, ***-****** room; with a great **** across the ****** of the *******, and *******, with high ***** to them, by the fire; on which were seated several ***** men in *****-******, ******** and *******.  They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young ******* sat in a corner by themselves, without being much ******** by their 



They had some cold **** for ******, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes ******** himself with three or four *****, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further.  Being much ***** with the walk, and ******* up so early, he ***** a little at first; then, quite *********** by ******* and the ***** of the *******, fell 



It was quite dark when he was awakened by a **** from Sikes. ******* himself ************ to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close ********** and ************* with a ********* man, over a **** of ***. 

'So, you're going on to Lower *********, are you?' inquired Sikes. 

'Yes, I am,' replied the man, who seemed a little the *****--** better, as the case might **--*** ********; 'and not **** about it neither.  My ***** ****'* got a **** behind him going back, as he had coming up in the ******'; and he won't be long *-***** of it.  Here's **** to him. ****! he's a good '**!' 

'Could you give my boy and me a **** as far as there?' demanded Sikes, ******* the *** towards his new friend. 

'If you're going directly, I can,' replied the man, looking out of the ***.  'Are you going to *********?' 

'Going on to **********,' replied Sikes. 

'I'm your man, as far as I go,' replied the other.  'Is all ****, 



'Yes, the other gentleman's ****,' replied the girl. 

'I say!' said the man, with ***** *******; 'that won't do, you know.' 

'Why not?' rejoined Sikes.  'You're *-***** to *********** us, and ***'* to ******* my standing ***** for a **** or so, in return?' 

The stranger ********* upon this ********, with a very ******** face; having done so, he ****** Sikes by the hand:  and ******** he was a real good fellow.  To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was ******; as, if he had been *****, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was. 

After the ******** of a few more ***********, they **** the company ****-*****, and went out; the girl ********* up the **** and ******* as they did so, and ******** out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party *****. 

The *****, whose ****** had been ***** in his *******, was standing outside:  ready ********* to the ****.  Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ********; and the man to whom he ********, having ******** for a minute or two 'to bear him up,' and to **** the ******* and the world to ******* his *****, ******* also.  Then, the ******* was told to give the ***** his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very ********** use of it:  ******* it into the air with great *******, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after ********** those *****, and ********** himself for a short time on his ****-****, he started off at great *****, and ******* out of the town right 



The night was very dark.  A **** **** rose from the *****, and the ****** ground about; and ****** itself over the ****** fields.  It was ******** cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the ****** had ***** ******; and Sikes was in no **** to **** him into conversation.  Oliver sat ******* together, in a corner of the ****; ********** with alarm and ************; and ******** strange ******* in the ***** *****, whose ******** ***** ****** to and fro, as if in some ********* joy at the ********** of the scene. 

As they passed ******* Church, the ***** struck *****.  There was a light in the *****-***** window opposite:  which ******** across the road, and threw into more ****** ****** a dark ***-**** with ****** beneath it.  There was a **** sound of falling water not far off; and the ****** of the old **** ******* gently in the night wind.  It seemed like quiet ***** for the ****** of the dead. 

******* was passed through, and they came again into the ****** road. Two or three miles more, and the **** stopped.  Sikes ********, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on. 

They turned into no house at **********, as the ***** boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in *** and darkness, through gloomy ***** and over cold open ******, until they came within sight of the ****** of a town at no great distance.  On looking ******** forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge. 

Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a **** upon the left. 

'The water!' thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.  'He has brought me to this ****** place to murder me!' 

He was about to ***** himself on the ground, and make one ******** for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a ******** house: all ******* and *******.  There was a window on each side of the *********** ********; and one story above; but no light was *******. The house was dark, **********: and the all appearance, ***********. 

Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly ********** the low *****, and raised the *****.  The door ******* to the ********, and they passed in together. 





CHAPTER **** 

THE ******** 

'*****!' cried a loud, ****** voice, as soon as they set foot in the 



'Don't make such a ***,' said Sikes, ******* the door.  'Show a ****, 



'***! my ***!' cried the same voice.  'A ****, Barney, a ****! Show the gentleman in, Barney; **** up first, if **********.' 

The ******* appeared to ***** a ****-****, or some such *******, at the person he addressed, to ***** him from his ********:  for the noise of a ****** body, falling *********, was heard; and then an ********** *********, as of a man between sleep and *****. 

'Do you hear?' cried the same voice.  'There's Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the ***** to him; and you ******** there, as if you took ******** with your *****, and nothing ********.  Are you any ******* now, or do you want the iron *********** to **** you 



A pair of ******** feet ********, hastily, across the **** floor of the room, as this ************* was put; and there ******, from a door on the right hand; first, a ****** candle:  and next, the form of the same ********** who has been ********** ********* as ********* under the ********* of speaking through his nose, and *********** as ****** at the public-house on ******* Hill. 

'****** Sikes!' exclaimed Barney, with real or *********** joy; '*** id, sir; *** id.' 

'Here! you get on first,' said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. '*******! or I shall ***** upon your *****.' 

********* a ***** upon his *********, Sikes ****** Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a ***** fire, two or three broken ******, a table, and a very old *****:  on which, with his legs much ****** than his head, a man was ******** at full length, ******* a long **** ****.  He was ******* in a *******-*** *****-******** coat, with large ***** *******; an ****** ***********; a ******, *******, *****-******* waistcoat; and **** ********.  Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great ******** of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a ******* ***, and ******** into long ********* *****, through which he ************ thrust some very dirty *******, ********** with large common *****.  He was a ****** above the ****** ****, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this ************ by no means ********* from his own ********** of his ***-*****, which he ************, in their ******** *********, with ****** satisfaction. 

'Bill, my boy!' said this ******, turning his head towards the door, 'I'm glad to see you.  I was almost afraid ***'* given it up:  in which case I should have made a ******** ******.  *****!' 

******** this *********** in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes ****** on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting *******, and demanded who that was. 

'The boy.  Only the boy!' replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the 



'*** of ****** *****'* ****,' exclaimed Barney, with a grin. 

'*****'*, eh!' exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.  'Wot an ********* boy ****'** make, for the old ladies' pockets in *******!  His *** is a ******' to him.' 

'*****--*****'* enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and ******** over his ********* friend, he whispered a few words in his ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed *********, and ******** Oliver with a long ***** of astonishment. 

'Now,' said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, 'if you'll give us something to eat and drink while we're *******, you'll put some heart in us; or in me, at all ******.  Sit down by the fire, *******, and rest yourself; for you'll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.' 

Oliver looked at Sikes, in **** and ***** wonder; and drawing a ***** to the fire, sat with his ****** head upon his hands, ********* knowing where he was, or what was passing ****** him. 

'Here,' said Toby, as the young Jew placed some ********* of ****, and a ****** upon the table,  '******* to the *****!'  He rose to honour the *****; and, carefully ********** his empty **** in a corner, ******** to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and ***** off its ********.  Mr. Sikes did the same. 

'A ***** for the boy,' said Toby, ****-******* a ****-*****. 'Down with it, *********.' 

'Indeed,' said Oliver, looking ********* up into the man's face; 'indeed, I--' 

'Down with it!' ****** Toby.  'Do you think I don't know what's good for you?  Tell him to drink it, Bill.' 

'He had better!' said Sikes ******** his hand upon his pocket. '**** my body, if he isn't more trouble than a whole family of *******.  Drink it, you ******** ***; drink it!' 

Frightened by the ******** ******** of the two men, Oliver hastily ********* the ******** of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of ********:  which ********* Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the ***** Mr. Sikes. 

This done, and Sikes having ********* his ******** (Oliver could eat nothing but a small ***** of bread which they made him *******), the two men laid themselves down on ****** for a short ***.  Oliver ******** his ***** by the fire; Barney ******* in a *******, ********* himself on the floor:  close outside the ******. 

They *****, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody ******** but Barney, who rose once or twice to ***** ***** on the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy ****:  ********* himself ******** along the gloomy *****, or ********* about the dark **********, or ********* some one or other of the ****** of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit ******* up and ********* it was ****-**** one. 

In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were ******** ******* in **** ***********.  Sikes and his companion ********* their ***** and ***** in large dark ******, and drew on their *****-*****; Barney, opening a ********, brought forth several ********, which he hastily ******* into the pockets. 

'******* for me, Barney,' said Toby Crackit. 

'Here they are,' replied Barney, ********* a pair of *******. 'You ****** them yourself.' 

'All right!' replied Toby, ******* them away.  'The **********?' 

'I've got 'em,' replied Sikes. 

'*****, ****, ******-****, *******--******* *********?' inquired Toby: ********* a small ******* to a **** inside the ***** of his coat. 

'All right,' rejoined his companion.  'Bring them **** of ******, Barney.  That's the time of day.' 

With these words, he took a thick stick from ******'* hands, who, having ********* another to Toby, ****** himself in ********* on Oliver's ****. 

'Now then!' said Sikes, ******* out his hand. 

Oliver:  who was ********** ********* by the ******** ********, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand ************ into that which Sikes ******** for the purpose. 

'Take his other hand, Toby,' said Sikes.  'Look out, Barney.' 

The man went to the door, and returned to ******** that all was quiet. The two ******* ****** forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, ****** himself up as before, and was soon ****** again. 

It was now ********* dark.  The *** was much ******* than it had been in the early part of the night; and the ********** was so ****, that, although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and ********, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become ***** with the ****-****** ******** that was ******** about.  They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the ****** which he had seen before.  They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty *******, they soon arrived at ********. 

'**** through the town,' whispered Sikes; '*****'** be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.' 

Toby **********; and they hurried through the **** street of the little town, which at that late hour was ****** ********.  A *** light ***** at ********* from some ***-**** window; and the ****** ******* of dogs ************ ***** the silence of the night.  But there was nobody ******.  They had ******* the town, as the ******-**** struck two. 

********** their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter of a ****, they stopped before a ******** house ********** by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely ******* to take breath, ******* in a *********. 

'The boy next,' said Toby.  '***** him up; I'll ***** hold of him.' 

Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four ******* he and Toby were lying on the ***** on the other side.  Sikes followed directly.  And they ***** ********** towards the house. 

And now, for the first time, Oliver, ****-**** mad with ***** and ******, saw that ************* and robbery, if not murder, were the ******* of the **********.  He ******* his hands together, and ************* uttered a ******* *********** of ******.  A **** came before his eyes; the cold ***** stood upon his **** face; his ***** ****** him; and he **** upon his knees. 

'Get up!' ******** Sikes, trembling with ****, and drawing the ****** from his pocket; 'Get up, or I'll ***** your ****** upon the *****.' 

'Oh! for ***'* sake let me go!' cried Oliver; 'let me run away and die in the fields.  I will never come near London; never, never!  Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me *****.  For the love of all the bright ****** that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!' 

The man to whom this ****** was made, ***** a dreadful ****, and had cocked the ******, when Toby, ******** it from his *****, placed his hand upon the boy's mouth, and ******* him to the house. 

'Hush!' cried the man; 'it won't answer here.  Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a ***** on the head.  That ***** no noise, and is quite as certain, and more *******.  Here, Bill, ****** the ******* open.  He's game enough now, I'll ******.  I've seen ***** hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold 



Sikes, ******** ******** ************ upon *****'* head for ******* Oliver on such an ******, ***** the ******* **********, but with little noise.  After some *****, and some ********** from Toby, the ******* to which he had ********, ***** open on its ******. 

It was a little ******* window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house:  which ******** to a ********, or small *******-*****, at the end of the passage.  The ******** was so small, that the ******* had ******** not thought it worth while to ****** it more ********; but it was large enough to ***** a boy of Oliver's ****, ************.  A very brief ******** of Mr. Sike's ***, ******** to ******** the ********* of the *******; and it soon stood **** open also. 

'Now listen, you young ****,' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and ******** the ***** full on Oliver's face; 'I'm a going to put you through there.  Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little ****, to the street door; ******** it, and let us in.' 

'There's a **** at the top, you won't be able to *****,' interposed Toby. 'Stand upon one of the **** ******.  There are three there, Bill, with a ***** large **** ******* and gold ********* on 'em:  which is the old ****'* arms.' 

'Keep quiet, can't you?' replied Sikes, with a *********** look. 'The ****-**** is open, is it?' 

'****,' replied Toby, after ******* in to ******* himself. 'The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a *****, so that the dog, ***'* got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he ***** *******.  Ha! ha! Barney '***** him away to-night.  So ****!' 

Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely ******* whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes *********** ********* him to be silent, and to get to work.  Toby ********, by first ********* his lantern, and ******* it on the ground; then by ******** himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, ******** upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his ******, ******* him ****** on the floor inside. 

'Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room.  'You see the stairs afore you?' 

Oliver, more dead than alive, ****** out, 'Yes.'  Sikes, pointing to the ******-**** with the ******-******, ******* ******* him to take notice that he was within **** all the way; and that if he ********, he would **** dead that instant. 

'It's done in a minute,' said Sikes, in the same low whisper. 'Directly I leave go of you, do your work.  ****!' 

'What's that?' whispered the other man. 

They listened ********. 

'Nothing,' said Sikes, ********* his hold of Oliver.  'Now!' 

In the short time he had had to ******* his ******, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the ******* or not, he would make one effort to **** upstairs from the ****, and alarm the family.  Filled with this ****, he ******** at once, but **********. 

'Come back!' suddenly cried Sikes *****.  'Back! back!' 

****** by the sudden ******** of the dead ********* of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern ****, and knew not whether to ******* or ***. 

The cry was ********--* light ********--* ****** of two ********* ****-******* men at the top of the stairs **** before his ****--* *****--* loud *****--* *****--* ***** *********, but where he knew ***,--*** he ********* back. 

Sikes had *********** for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the ****** before the ***** had ******* away.  He ***** his own ****** after the men, who were already **********; and ******* the boy 



'***** your arm *******,' said Sikes, as he drew him through the window.  'Give me a ***** here.  ****'** *** him.  Quick!  How the boy 



Then came the loud ******* of a bell, ******* with the noise of ****-****, and the ****** of men, and the ********* of being carried over ****** ground at a ***** pace.  And then, the ****** grew ******** in the distance; and a cold ****** feeling crept over the boy's heart; and he saw or heard no more. 





CHAPTER ***** 

WHICH ******** THE ********* OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND ***** THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE *********** ON SOME ****** 

The night was ****** cold.  The **** lay on the ground, ****** into a hard thick *****, so that only the ***** that had ******* into ****** and ******* were ******** by the sharp wind that ****** ******:  which, as if ********* ********* **** on such **** as it found, caught it ******** up in ******, and, ******** it into a ******** ***** ******, ********* it in air.  *****, dark, and ******** cold, it was a night for the ****-****** and *** to **** round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the ********, ******** ****** to lay him down and die.  Many ******-**** ******** close their eyes in our **** streets, at such times, who, let their ****** have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more ****** world. 

Such was the ****** of ***-**-***** *******, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our ******* have been already ********** as the ********** of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a ******** fire in her own little room, and *******, with no small ****** of ***********, at a small round table:  on which stood a **** of ************* ****, ********* with all necessary ********* for the most ******** **** that ******* *****.  In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to ****** herself with a *** of tea. As she ******* from the table to the *********, where the ******** of all possible ******* was ******* a small **** in a small voice, her ****** satisfaction ********* *********,--** much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled. 

'Well!' said the matron, ******* her ***** on the table, and looking ************ at the fire; 'I'm sure we have all on us a great deal to be ******** for!  A great deal, if we did but know it.  Ah!' 

Mrs. Corney shook her head **********, as if ********* the ****** ********* of those paupers who did not know it; and ********* a ****** ***** (******* ********) into the ****** ******** of a ***-***** *** ***-*****, proceeded to make the tea. 

How slight a thing will ******* the ********** of our ***** *****!  The black ******, being very small and ****** filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was **********; and the water ******** ******* Mrs. ******'* 



'**** the ***!' said the worthy matron, ******* it down very hastily on the ***; 'a little ****** thing, that only ***** a couple of ****! What use is it of, to anybody!  Except,' said Mrs. Corney, *******, 'except to a poor ******** creature like me.  Oh dear!' 

With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more ******* her ***** on the table, thought of her ******** ****.  The small ******, and the ****** ***, had awakened in her mind *** ************* of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than ****-***-****** years); and she was ***********. 

'I shall never get another!' said Mrs. Corney, *********; 'I shall never get *******--**** him.' 

Whether this remark **** ********* to the *******, or the ******, is *********.  It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.  She had just ****** her first ***, when she was ********* by a **** *** at the ****-****. 

'Oh, come in with you!' said Mrs. Corney, *******.  'Some of the old women *****, I suppose.  They always die when I'm at *****. Don't stand there, ******* the cold air in, don't.  What's ***** now, eh?' 

'Nothing, ma'am, nothing,' replied a man's voice. 

'Dear me!' exclaimed the matron, in a much ******* tone, 'is that Mr. 



'At your *******, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to *** his ***** *****, and to ***** the **** off his coat; and who now made his appearance, ******* the cocked hat in one hand and a ****** in the other.  'Shall I shut the door, ma'am?' 

The lady ******** ********* to reply, **** there should be any *********** in ******* an ********* with Mr. Bumble, with closed *****. Mr. Bumble taking ********* of the **********, and being very cold himself, shut it without **********. 

'Hard *******, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron. 

'Hard, indeed, ma'am,' replied the beadle.  '****-********* ******* this, ma'am.  We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty ******** ****** and a ****** and a half, this very ******* *********; and yet them paupers are not *********.' 

'Of course not.  When would they be, Mr. Bumble?' said the matron, ******* her tea. 

'When, indeed, ma'am!' rejoined Mr. Bumble.  'Why here's one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a ******** **** and a good pound of ******, full ******.  Is he ********, ma'am?  Is he ********?  Not a ****** ********'* worth of it!  What does he do, ma'am, but ask for a few *****; if it's only a pocket handkerchief full, he says!  *****! What would he do with *****?  ***** his ****** with 'em and then come back for more.  That's the way with these people, ma'am; give 'em a ***** full of ***** **-***, and ****'** come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as ****** as *********.' 

The matron ********* her ****** *********** in this ************ ******; and the beadle went on. 

'I never,' said Mr. Bumble, 'see anything like the ***** it's got to. The day afore *********, a ***--*** have been a ******* woman, ma'am, and I may ******* it to ***--* man, with hardly a *** upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), **** to our ********'* door when he has got company coming to ******; and says, he must be ********, Mrs. Corney.  As he wouldn't go away, and ******* the company very much, our ******** sent him out a pound of ******** and half a **** of *******.  "My heart!" says the ********** *******, "what's the use of _this_ to me?  You might as well give me a pair of iron **********!"  "Very good," says our ********, taking 'em away again, "you won't get anything else here."  "Then I'll die in the streets!" says the *******.  "Oh no, you won't," says our ********.' 

'Ha! ha!  That was very good!  So like Mr. ********, wasn't it?' interposed the matron.  'Well, Mr. Bumble?' 

'Well, ma'am,' rejoined the beadle, 'he went away; and he _did_ die in the streets.  There's a ********* ****** for you!' 

'It ***** anything I could have ********,' observed the matron ************.  'But don't you think ***-**-**** ****** a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?  You're a gentleman of **********, and ought to know.  Come.' 

'Mrs. Corney,' said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are ********* of ******** ***********, '***-**-**** ******, ******** *******: ******** *******, ma'am: is the porochial *********.  The great ********* of ***-**-**** ****** is, to give the paupers ******* what they don't want; and then they get ***** of coming.' 

'Dear me!' exclaimed Mrs. Corney.  'Well, that is a good one, too!' 

'Yes.  ******* you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, 'that's the great *********; and that's the reason why, if you look at any ***** that get into them ********* **********, you'll always ******* that sick ******** have been ******** with ****** of ******.  That's the **** now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,' said the beadle, stopping to ****** his ******, 'these are ******** *******, ma'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial ********, such as *********. This is the **** ****, ma'am, that the board ******* for the *********; real, fresh, ******* **** ****; only out of the **** this ********; clear as a bell, and no ********!' 

Having held the first ****** up to the light, and ****** it well to **** its **********, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a ***** of *******; ****** the handkerchief in which they had been *******; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go. 

'You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron. 

'It *****, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his ****-******, 'enough to cut ***'* ears off.' 

The matron looked, from the little ******, to the beadle, who was ****** towards the door; and as the beadle *******, *********** to ******* her ****-*****, ********* inquired *******--******* he wouldn't take a *** of tea? 

Mr. Bumble *************** turned back his ****** again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.  As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.  She fixed her eyes upon the little ******.  Mr. Bumble ******* again, and ******** smiled. 

Mrs. Corney rose to get another *** and ****** from the ******. As she sat down, her eyes once again *********** those of the ******* beadle; she ********, and ******* herself to the **** of making his tea.  Again Mr. Bumble *******--****** this time than he had ******* yet. 

'Sweet?  Mr. Bumble?' inquired the matron, taking up the *****-*****. 

'Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble.  He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked ******, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment. 

The tea was made, and ****** in silence.  Mr. Bumble, having ****** a handkerchief over his knees to ******* the ****** from ******** the ********* of his ******, began to eat and drink; ******* these **********, ************, by ******** a deep ****; which, however, had no ********* effect upon his ********, but, on the ********, rather seemed to ********** his ********** in the tea and ***** **********. 

'You have a ***, ma'am, I see,' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the ****** of her family, was ******* before the fire; 'and ******* too, I *******!' 

'I am so **** of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,' replied the matron.  'They're _so_ happy, _so_ **********, and _so_ ********, that they are quite companions for me.' 

'Very **** *******, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, ***********; 'so very 



'Oh, yes!' rejoined the matron with **********; 'so **** of their home too, that it's quite a pleasure, I'm sure.' 

'Mrs. Corney, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and ******* the time with his ********, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any ***, or ******, that could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be **** of its home, must be a ***, ma'am.' 

'Oh, Mr. Bumble!' ************ Mrs. Corney. 

'It's of no use ********** *****, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly *********** the ******** with a kind of ******* ******* which made him ****** **********; 'I would ***** it myself, with pleasure.' 

'Then you're a ***** man,' said the matron ***********, as she held out her hand for the ******'* ***; 'and a very ****-******* man besides.' 

'****-*******, ma'am?' said Mr. Bumble.  'Hard?'  Mr. Bumble ******** his *** without another word; ******** Mrs. ******'* little ****** as she took it; and ********** two ****-****** ***** upon his ***** waistcoat, gave a ****** ****, and ******* his chair a very little ****** ******* from the fire. 

It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and ******** the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in ******** from the fire, and still ******* at the table, ********* the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which **********, some ******* ******* will ********* be disposed to ******, and to ******** an *** of great ******* on Mr. Bumble's part:  he being in some sort ******* by time, place, and opportunity, to give ********* to certain **** ********, which however well they may become the lips of the light and ***********, do **** ************ beneath the ******* of ****** of the ****, ******* of **********, ********* of state, **** ******, and other great public *************, but more ************ beneath the *********** and ******* of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be the ******** and most ********** among them all. 

******** were Mr. Bumble's **********, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it ************* happened, as has been twice before ********, that the table was a round one; ************ Mr. Bumble, ****** his chair by little and little, soon began to ******** the distance between himself and the matron; and, ********** to ****** round the ***** **** of the ******, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated. 

Indeed, the two ****** *******; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble 



Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been ******** by the fire; and if to the left, she must have ****** into Mr. Bumble's arms; so (being a ******** matron, and no doubt ********** these ************ at a glance) she remained where she was, and ****** Mr. Bumble another *** of tea. 

'****-*******, Mrs. Corney?' said Mr. Bumble, ******** his tea, and looking up into the ******'* face; 'are _you_ ****-*******, Mrs. 



'Dear me!' exclaimed the matron, 'what a very ******* question from a ****** man.  What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?' 

The beadle ***** his tea to the last drop; ******** a piece of *****; ******* the ****** off his knees; ***** his lips; and ************ ****** the matron. 

'Mr. Bumble!' cried that ******** lady in a whisper; for the ****** was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, 'Mr. Bumble, I shall ******!'  Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a **** and ********* manner, put his arm round the ******'* *****. 

As the lady had ****** her ********* of *********, of course she would have ******** at this ********** ********, but that the ******** was rendered *********** by a ***** ******** at the door:  which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble ******, with much *******, to the **** *******, and began ******* them with great violence:  while the matron ******* demanded who was there. 

It is worthy of remark, as a ******* ******** ******** of the ******** of a sudden surprise in ************* the ******* of ******* fear, that her voice had quite ********* all its ******** ********. 

'If you please, ********,' said a ******** old female ******, ********* ****:  putting her head in at the door, 'Old ***** is *-***** fast.' 

'Well, what's that to me?' ******* demanded the matron.  'I can't keep her alive, can I?' 

'No, no, ********,' replied the old woman, 'nobody can; she's far beyond the ***** of help.  I've seen a many people die; little ***** and great strong men; and I know when *****'* *-******, well enough. But she's ******** in her mind: and when the **** are not on ***,--*** that's not often, for she is ***** very ****,--*** says she has got something to tell, which you must hear.  ***'** never die quiet till you come, ********.' 

At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a ******* of ********** against old women who couldn't even die without ********* ******** their *******; and, ******** herself in a thick ***** which she hastily caught up, ******* ********* Mr. Bumble to **** till she came back, **** anything particular should *****.  ******* the ********* walk fast, and not be all night ******** up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill *****, ******** all the way. 

Mr. Bumble's ******* on being left to himself, was rather ************. He opened the ******, ******* the *********, ******* the *****-*****, ******* ********* a ****** ****-*** to ********* that it was of the ******* *****, and, having ********* his ********* on these ******, put on his cocked hat ******-****, and ****** with much ******* four ******** times round the table. 

Having gone through this very ************* ***********, he took off the cocked hat again, and, ********* himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be ******** ******* in taking an ***** ********* of the *********. 





CHAPTER **** 

****** ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT.  BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF ********** IN THIS HISTORY 

It was no ***** ********* of death, who had ********* the quiet of the ******'* room.  Her body was **** by age; her ***** ******** with *****; her face, ********* into a ******** ****, ********* more the ********* ******* of some **** ******, than the work of ******'* hand. 

****!  How few of ******'* faces are left alone to ******* us with their ******!  The *****, and *******, and **********, of the world, change them as they change ******; and it is only when those ******** sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the ******** ****** **** off, and leave ******'* ******* clear.  It is a common thing for the ************ of the dead, even in that fixed and ***** state, to ******* into the ****-********* expression of ******** *******, and ****** into the very look of early life; so ****, so ********, do they **** again, that those who knew them in their happy *********, ***** by the ******'* side in ***, and see the ***** even upon earth. 

The old ***** ******** along the ********, and up the stairs, ********* some ********** ******* to the ******** of her companion; being at length ********* to ***** for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more ****** ******** made her way to the room where the sick woman lay. 

It was a **** ******-****, with a *** light ******* at the ******* end. There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish **********'* ********** was standing by the fire, making a ********* out of a *****. 

'Cold night, Mrs. Corney,' said this young gentleman, as the matron 



'Very cold, indeed, sir,' replied the ********, in her most ***** *****, and ******** a ******* as she spoke. 

'You should get better ***** out of your ***********,' said the **********'* ******, ******** a **** on the top of the fire with the ***** *****; 'these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.' 

'They're the *****'* ********, sir,' returned the matron. 'The least they could do, would be to keep us pretty ****:  for our ****** are hard enough.' 

The conversation was here *********** by a **** from the sick woman. 

'Oh!' said the young ***, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had ********** quite ********* the *******, 'it's all U.P. there, Mrs. 



'It is, is it, sir?' asked the matron. 

'If she ***** a couple of hours, I shall be *********,' said the **********'* **********, ****** upon the *********'* point. 'It's a *****-** of the ****** **********.  Is she ******, old lady?' 

The ********* ******* over the bed, to *********; and nodded in the 



'Then perhaps ***'** go off in that way, if you don't make a ***,' said the young man.  'Put the light on the floor.  She won't see it there.' 

The ********* did as she was told:  shaking her head meanwhile, to ******** that the woman would not die so ******; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other *****, who had by this time returned.  The ********, with an expression of **********, ******* herself in her *****, and sat at the foot of the bed. 

The **********'* **********, having ********* the *********** of the *********, ******* himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so:  when apparently ******* rather ****, he ****** Mrs. Corney joy of her ***, and took himself off on ******. 

When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and ********* over the fire, held out their ******** hands to ***** the ****.  The ***** threw a ******* light on their ********** faces, and made their ******** ****** ********, as, in this position, they began to ******** in a low voice. 

'Did she say any more, **** dear, while I was gone?' inquired the 



'Not a word,' replied the other.  'She ******* and **** at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off.  She ****'* much strength in her, so I ****** kept her quiet.  I ain't so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish *********; no, no!' 

'Did she drink the *** **** the doctor said she was to have?' demanded the first. 

'I tried to get it down,' rejoined the other.  'But her teeth were ***** set, and she ******** the *** so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again.  So I ***** it; and it did me good!' 

Looking ********** round, to ********* that they were not *********, the two **** ******* ****** to the fire, and ******** ********. 

'I mind the time,' said the first *******, 'when she would have done the same, and made **** *** of it afterwards.' 

'**, that she would,' rejoined the other; 'she had a merry heart. 'A many, many, beautiful ******* she laid out, as **** and **** as *******.  My old eyes have seen ****--**, and those old hands ******* them too; for I have ****** her, ****** of times.' 

********** forth her trembling ******* as she spoke, the old creature shook them ********** before her face, and ******** in her pocket, brought out an old ****-*********** *** *****-***, from which she shook a few ****** into the ************ **** of her companion, and a few more into her own.  While they were thus ********, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the ***** woman should ****** from her ******, ****** them by the fire, and ******* asked how long she was to 



'Not long, ********,' replied the second woman, looking up into her face.  'We have none of us long to **** for Death.  ********, ********! He'll be here soon enough for us all.' 

'Hold your ******, you ****** *****!' said the matron *******. 'You, ******, tell me; has she been in this way before?' 

'Often,' answered the first woman. 

'But will never be again,' added the second one; 'that is, ***'** never **** again but ****--*** mind, ********, that won't be for long!' 

'Long or short,' said the matron, **********, 'she won't find me here when she does ****; take care, both of you, how you ***** me again for nothing.  It's no part of my **** to see all the old women in the house die, and I ***'*--****'* more. Mind that, you ******** old *********. If you make a **** of me again, I'll soon **** you, I ******* you!' 

She was ******** away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, ****** her to look round.  The ******* had raised herself *******, and was ********** her arms towards them. 

'***'* that?' she cried, in a ****** voice. 

'Hush, hush!' said one of the women, ******** over her.  'Lie down, lie 



'I'll never lie down again alive!' said the woman, **********. 'I _will_ tell her!  Come here!  ******!  Let me whisper in your ear.' 

She ******** the matron by the arm, and ******* her into a chair by the *******, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women ******* forward in the attitude of ***** *********. 

'Turn them away,' said the woman, ********; 'make *****! make *****!' 

The two old ******, ******* in together, began ******* out many ******* ************ that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were ******** ****** ************* that they would never leave her, when the ******** ****** them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the *******.  On being ********, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the ******* that old ***** was *****; which, indeed, was not ********; since, in ******** to a ******** **** of ***** ********** by the **********, she was ********* under the ******* of a ***** ***** of ***-***-***** which had been ******* ************, in the ******** of their ******, by the worthy old ladies themselves. 

'Now listen to me,' said the ***** woman *****, as if making a great effort to ****** one ****** ***** of ******.  'In this very ****--** this very ***--* once ****** a pretty young *******', that was brought into the house with her feet cut and ******* with walking, and all ****** with **** and blood.  She gave birth to a boy, and died.  Let me *****--**** was the year again!' 

'Never mind the year,' said the ********* *******; 'what about her?' 

'**,' ******** the sick woman, ********* into her former ****** state, 'what about ***?--**** *****--* know!' she cried, ******* ******** up: her face *******, and her eyes starting from her ****--'* ****** her, so I did!  She wasn't ****--* tell you she wasn't cold, when I ***** 



'***** what, for ***'* sake?' cried the matron, with a ******* as if she would call for help. 

'_It_!' replied the woman, laying her hand over the other's mouth. 'The only thing she had.  She wanted clothes to keep her ****, and **** to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her *****.  It was gold, I tell you!  **** gold, that might have ***** her life!' 

'Gold!' ****** the matron, ******* eagerly over the woman as she fell back.  'Go on, go **--***--**** of it?  Who was the mother? When was 



'She ****** me to keep it safe,' replied the woman with a *****, 'and ******* me as the only woman about her.  I ***** it in my heart when she first showed it me ******* round her neck; and the *****'* death, perhaps, is on me besides!  They would have ******* him better, if they had known it all!' 

'Known what?' asked the other.  'Speak!' 

'The boy grew so like his mother,' said the woman, ******** on, and not ******* the question, 'that I could never ****** it when I saw his face.  Poor girl! poor girl!  She was so young, too! Such a gentle ****!  ****; there's more to tell.  I have not told you all, have I?' 

'No, no,' replied the matron, ********* her head to ***** the words, as they came more ******* from the ***** woman.  'Be quick, or it may be too late!' 

'The mother,' said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; 'the mother, when the ***** of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her **** was born alive, and *******, the day might come when it would not feel so much ********* to hear its poor young mother *****. "And oh, kind Heaven!" she said, ******* her **** hands together, "whether it be boy or girl, ***** up some friends for it in this ******** world, and take pity upon a ****** ******** child, ********* to its mercy!"' 

'The boy's name?' demanded the matron. 

'They _called_ him Oliver,' replied the woman, ******.  'The gold I ***** was--' 

'Yes, ***--****?' cried the other. 

She was ******* eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, *************, as she once again rose, slowly and *******, into a sitting *******; then, ********* the ******** with both hands, muttered some ********** ****** in her throat, and fell ******** on the bed. 

      *      *      *      *      * 

'Stone dead!' said one of the old women, ******** in as soon as the door was opened. 

'And nothing to tell, after all,' rejoined the matron, walking ********** away. 

The two ******, to all appearance, too ****** ******** in the ************ for their dreadful ****** to make any reply, were left alone, ******** about the body. 





CHAPTER *** 

******* THIS HISTORY ******* TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY 

While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old ***--*** same from which Oliver had been ******* by the ****--******** over a ****, ***** fire.  He held a pair of ******* upon his ****, with which he had apparently been ************ to ***** it into more ******** action; but he had ****** into deep thought; and with his arms ****** on them, and his **** ******* on his ******, fixed his eyes, ************, on the ***** ****. 

At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master ******* Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all ****** upon a game of *****; the Artful taking ***** against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.  The countenance of the *****-***** gentleman, ********** *********** at all times, ******** great ********** interest from his close ********** of the game, and his ********* ******* of Mr. ********'* hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion ******, he ******** a ******* of earnest *******: ****** ********** his own **** by the ****** of his ************ upon his *********'* *****.  It being a cold night, the Dodger **** his hat, as, indeed, was often his ****** within *****.  He also ********* a **** **** between his teeth, which he only ******* for a brief space when he ****** it necessary to ***** for *********** to a ***** *** upon the table, which stood ready filled with ***-***-***** for the ************* of the company. 

Master Bates was also ********* to the ****; but being of a more ********* nature than his ************ friend, it was ********** that he more ********** ******* himself to the ***-***-*****, and ******** ******** in many ***** and ********** *******, all ****** ********** a ********** ******.  Indeed, the Artful, ********* upon their close **********, more than once took occasion to reason ******* with his companion upon these *************; all of which *************, Master Bates received in ********* good part; merely ********** his friend to be '******,' or to ****** his head in a ****, or ******** with some other ******-****** ********* of a ******* kind, the happy *********** of which, ******* ************ ********** in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was ********** that the latter gentleman and his ******* ********** lost; and that the ************, so far from ******** Master Bates, appeared to ****** him the ******* *********, ******** as he laughed most ************ at the end of every deal, and ********* that he had never seen such a ***** game in all his born days. 

'That's two ******* and the ***,' said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew ****-*-***** from his *********-******.  'I never see such a ****** as you, ****; you *** everything.  Even when **'** good *****, Charley and I can't make nothing of 'em.' 

Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ********, ********* Charley Bates so much, that his ********** ***** of ******** roused the Jew from his *******, and ******* him to ******* what was the matter. 

'Matter, Fagin!' cried Charley.  'I wish you had watched the ****. ***** Chitling ****'* *** a point; and I went ******** with him against the ******* and ****.' 

'**, **!' said the Jew, with a grin, which ************ ************ that he was at no loss to understand the reason. '*** 'em again, Tom; *** 'em again.' 

'No more of it for me, thank '**, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've had enough.  That '*** Dodger has such a run of **** that there's no standing again' him.' 

'Ha! ha! my dear,' replied the Jew, 'you must get up very early in the morning, to *** against the Dodger.' 

'Morning!' said Charley Bates; 'you must put your ***** on ****-*****, and have a ********* at each eye, and a *****-***** between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.' 

Mr. Dawkins received these ******** *********** with much **********, and ******* to cut any gentleman in company, for the first *******-****, at a ******** at a time.  Nobody ********* the *********, and his **** being by this time ****** out, he proceeded to ***** himself by ********* a ******-**** of ******* on the table with the piece of ***** which had ****** him in **** of ********; *********, ********, with ******** **********. 

'How ******** **** you are, *****!' said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and ********** Mr. Chitling.  'What do you think he's thinking of, Fagin?' 

'How should I know, my dear?' replied the Jew, looking round as he ***** the *******.  'About his ******, *****; or the little ********** in the country that he's just left, eh?  Ha! ha!  Is that it, my dear?' 

'Not a bit of it,' replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of ********* as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.  'What do _you_ say, 



'_I_ should say,' replied Master Bates, with a grin, 'that he was ******** sweet upon *****.  See how he's *-********!  Oh, my eye! here's a *****-**-*******!  ***** ********'* in love!  Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a *****!' 

********** *********** with the ****** of Mr. Chitling being the ****** of the ****** passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his *******, and ******* over upon the floor; where (the ******** ******* nothing of his *********) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh. 

'Never mind him, my dear,' said the Jew, ******* at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a ********* *** with the ****** of the *******. '*****'* a fine girl.  Stick up to her, Tom.  Stick up to her.' 

'What I mean to say, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.' 

'No more it is,' replied the Jew; 'Charley will talk.  Don't mind him, my dear; don't mind him.  *****'* a fine girl.  Do as she **** you, Tom, and you will make your *******.' 

'So I _do_ do as she **** me,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I *******'* have been ******, if it ****'* been for her ******.  But it turned out a good *** for you; didn't it, Fagin!  And what's six ***** of it?  It must come, some time or another, and why not in the ****** time when you don't want to go out *-******* so much; eh, Fagin?' 

'Ah, to be sure, my dear,' replied the Jew. 

'You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,' asked the Dodger, ******* upon Charley and the Jew, 'if *** was all right?' 

'I mean to say that I *******'*,' replied Tom, *******. 'There, now. Ah!  ***'** say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?' 

'Nobody, my dear,' replied the Jew; 'not a soul, Tom.  I don't know one of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear.' 

'I might have got clear off, if I'd ***** upon her; ******'* I, Fagin?' ******* pursued the poor ****-****** ****.  'A word from me would have done it; wouldn't it, Fagin?' 

'To be sure it would, my dear,' replied the Jew. 

'But I didn't **** it; did I, Fagin?' demanded Tom, ******* question upon question with great **********. 

'No, no, to be sure,' replied the Jew; 'you were too *****-******* for that.  A deal too *****, my dear!' 

'Perhaps I was,' rejoined Tom, looking round; 'and if I was, what's to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?' 

The Jew, ********** that Mr. Chitling was ************ roused, ******** to ****** him that nobody was ********; and to ***** the ******* of the company, ******** to Master Bates, the ********* ********.  But, *************, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more ******* in his life, was ****** to ******* the ****** of such a violent ****, that the ****** Mr. Chitling, without any *********** **********, ****** across the room and ***** a blow at the ********; who, being ******* in ******* *******, ****** to ***** it, and ***** his time so well that it ******* on the ***** of the merry old gentleman, and ****** him to ******* to the wall, where he stood ******* for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in ******* ******. 

'****!' cried the Dodger at this moment, 'I heard the *******.' Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs. 

The bell was **** again, with some **********, while the party were in darkness.  After a short *****, the Dodger **********, and whispered Fagin ************. 

'What!' cried the Jew, 'alone?' 

The Dodger nodded in the ***********, and, ******* the ***** of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a ******* **********, in **** show, that he had better not be ***** just then.  Having ********* this ******** office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew's face, and ******* his 



The old man bit his ****** *******, and ********* for some *******; his face ******* with ********* the while, as if he ******* something, and ****** to know the *****.  At length he raised his head. 

'Where is he?' he asked. 

The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a *******, as if to leave the room. 

'Yes,' said the Jew, ********* the **** inquiry; 'bring him down. Hush! Quiet, Charley!  Gently, Tom!  ******, ******!' 

This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his ****** **********, was softly and immediately ******.  There was no sound of their **********, when the Dodger ********* the stairs, ******* the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a ****** *****-*****; who, after ******* a hurried glance round the room, ****** off a large ******* which had ********* the lower ******* of his face, and *********: all *******, ********, and *******: the features of ***** Toby Crackit. 

'How are you, ******?' said this worthy, ******* to the Jew. '*** that ***** away in my ******, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that's the time of day!  You'll be a fine young ********* afore the old **** now.' 

With these words he ****** up the *****-*****; and, ******* it round his ******, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the ***. 

'See there, ******,' he said, pointing ************** to his top *****; 'not a drop of Day and ****** since you know when; not a ****** of ********, by ****!   But don't look at me in that way, man.  All in good time.  I can't talk about business till I've eat and *****; so ******* the ***********, and ***'* have a quiet ****-*** for the first time these three days!' 

The Jew ******** to the Dodger to place what ******** there were, upon the table; and, ******* himself opposite the ************, ****** his 



To ***** from ***********, Toby was by no means in a ***** to open the conversation.  At first, the Jew ********* himself with ********* watching his countenance, as if to **** from its expression some **** to the intelligence he brought; but in ****. 

He looked ***** and ****, but there was the same ********** ****** upon his features that they always ****:  and through ****, and *****, and *******, there still *****, **********, the ****-********* ***** of ***** Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an ***** of **********, watched every ****** he put into his mouth; ****** up and down the room, meanwhile, in ************* **********.  It was all of no use.  Toby continued to eat with the ****** ******* ************, until he could eat no more; then, ******** the Dodger out, he closed the door, ***** a glass of spirits and water, and ******** himself for talking. 

'First and ********, ******,' said Toby. 

'Yes, yes!' interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair. 

Mr. Crackit stopped to take a ******* of spirits and water, and to ******* that the *** was *********; then ******* his feet against the low ***********, so as to bring his ***** to about the ***** of his eye, he ******* resumed. 

'First and ********, ******,' said the ************, '***'* Bill?' 

'What!' ******** the Jew, starting from his seat. 

'Why, you don't mean to say--' began Toby, turning pale. 

'Mean!' cried the Jew, ******** ********* on the ground. 'Where are they?  Sikes and the boy!  Where are they?  Where have they been? Where are they ******?  Why have they not been here?' 

'The ***** ******,' said Toby *******. 

'I know it,' replied the Jew, ******* a ********* from his pocket and pointing to it.  'What more?' 

'They ***** and *** the boy.  We cut over the fields at the back, with him between **--******** as the **** *****--******* ***** and ditch. They gave *****.  *****! the whole country was *****, and the dogs upon 



'The boy!' 

'Bill had him on his back, and ******* like the wind.  We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon our *****; every man for himself, and each from the *******! We ****** company, and left the ********* lying in a ditch.  Alive or dead, that's all I know about him.' 

The Jew stopped to hear no more; but ******** a loud ****, and ******* his hands in his hair, ****** from the room, and from the house. 





CHAPTER **** 

IN WHICH A ********** ********* ******* UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, *********** FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND ********* 

The old man had ****** the street corner, before he began to ******* the effect of Toby *******'* intelligence.  He had ******* nothing of his ******* *****; but was still ******** ******, in the same **** and ********** manner, when the sudden ******* past of a ********: and a ********** cry from the foot **********, who saw his danger:  ***** him back upon the ********.  ********, as much as was possible, all the **** streets, and ******** only through the **-**** and ******, he at length ******* on **** Hill.  Here he walked even ****** than before; nor did he ****** until he had again turned into a *****; when, as if ********* that he was now in his ****** *******, he fell into his usual ********* pace, and seemed to ******* more ******. 

Near to the spot on which **** Hill and ******* Hill ****, *****, upon the right hand as you come out of the ****, a narrow and ****** *****, ******* to ******* Hill.  In its ****** ***** are ******* for **** **** ******* of ******-**** **** *************, of all ***** and ********; for here ****** the ******* who ******** them from ****-*******. ******** of these ************* **** ******** from **** outside the windows or ********* from the ****-*****; and the *******, within, are ***** with them. ******** as the ****** of ***** **** are, it has its ******, its ******-****, its ****-****, and its *****-**** *********. It is a ********** ****** of itself:  the ******** of ***** *******: ******* at early morning, and *******-** of ****, by silent *********, who ******* in dark ****-********, and who go as ********* as they come.  Here, the **********, the ****-******, and the ***-********, ******* their *****, as ****-****** to the ***** thief; here, ****** of old iron and *****, and ***** of ******* ********* of *******-***** and *****, **** and *** in the ***** *******. 

It was into this place that the Jew turned.  He was well known to the ****** ******** of the ****; for such of them as were on the ****-*** to *** or ****, nodded, **********, as he passed along. He replied to their *********** in the same way; but ******** no ****** *********** until he reached the further end of the *****; when he stopped, to ******* a ******** of small *******, who had ******** as much of his person into a *****'* chair as the chair would hold, and was ******* a **** at his ********* door. 

'Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would **** the ********!' said this *********** ******, in ************** of the Jew's inquiry after his 



'The ************* was a little too ***, ******,' said Fagin, ********* his ********, and ******** his hands upon his shoulders. 

'Well, I've ***** that ********* of it, once or twice before,' replied the ******; 'but it soon ***** down again; don't you find it so?' 

Fagin nodded in the ***********.  Pointing in the direction of ******* Hill, he inquired whether any one was up ****** to-night. 

'At the ********?' inquired the man. 

The Jew nodded. 

'Let me see,' pursued the ********, **********. 

'Yes, there's some ****-***** of 'em gone in, that I knows. I don't think your friend's there.' 

'Sikes is not, I suppose?' inquired the Jew, with a ************ 



'_*** *********_, as the ******* say,' replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking ********* ***.  'Have you got anything in my **** 



'Nothing to-night,' said the Jew, turning away. 

'Are you going up to the ********, Fagin?' cried the little man, ******* after him.  'Stop!  I don't mind if I have a drop there with 



But as the Jew, looking back, ***** his hand to ******** that he ********* being alone; and, ********, as the little man could not very ****** ********* himself from the chair; the **** of the ******** was, for a time, ****** of the ********* of Mr. ******'* presence.  By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had ***********; so Mr. ******, after ************* standing on ******, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, ********** a ***** of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and ******** were ******* *******, resumed his **** with a grave *********. 

The Three ********, or rather the ********; which was the **** by which the ************* was ********** known to its *******:  was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already *******. Merely making a **** to a man at the ***, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly *********** himself into the *******, looked ********* about: ******* his eyes with his hand, as if in ****** of some particular person. 

The room was *********** by two ***-******; the ***** of which was ********* by the ****** ********, and *******-***** ******** of ***** red, from being ******* outside.  The ******* was *********, to ******* its ****** from being ******* by the ******* of the *****; and the place was so full of ***** ******* *****, that at first it was scarcely possible to ******* anything more.  By *******, however, as some of it ******* away through the open door, an ********** of heads, as ******** as the ****** that ******* the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more ********** to the scene, the ********* gradually became ***** of the presence of a ******** company, **** and female, crowded round a long table: at the ***** end of which, sat a ******** with a ****** of office in his hand; while a ************ gentleman with a ****** nose, and his face **** up for the ******* of a *********, ******** at a ******** ***** in a ****** corner. 

As Fagin ******* softly in, the ************ gentleman, running over the **** by way of *******, ********** a ******* cry of order for a ****; which having ********, a young lady proceeded to ********* the company with a ****** in four ******, between each of which the ************ ****** the ****** all through, as loud as he could.  When this was over, the ******** gave a *********, after which, the ************ gentleman on the ********'* right and left *********** a ****, and **** it, with great ********. 

It was ******* to ******* some faces which stood out *********** from among the *****.  There was the ******** himself, (the ******** of the house,) a ******, *****, heavy ***** fellow, who, while the ***** were **********, ****** his eyes ****** and *******, and, ******* to give himself up to *********, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was ****--*** sharp ****, too.  Near him were the *******: *********, with ************ ************, the *********** of the company, and ******** themselves, in turn, to a ***** ********* ******* of spirits and water, ******** by their more ********** ********; whose ************, ********** of almost every **** in almost every *****, ************ ********* the attention, by their very *************.  *******, ********, and ********** in all its ******, were there, in their ********* ******; and women: some with the last ********* ***** of their early ********* almost ****** as you looked:  others with every **** and ***** of their *** ******* ****** out, and ********** but one ********* ***** of ********** and *****; some mere *****, others but young women, and none past the ***** of life; ****** the ******* and ******* ******* of this ****** *******. 

Fagin, ******** by no grave ********, looked eagerly from face to face while these *********** were in ********; but apparently without ******* that of which he was in ******. **********, at length, in catching the eye of the man who ******** the chair, he ******** to him ********, and left the room, as ******* as he had entered it. 

'What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?' inquired the man, as he followed him out to the *******.  'Won't you **** us?  ****'** be *********, every one of 'em.' 

The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, 'Is _he_ 



'No,' replied the man. 

'And no **** of Barney?' inquired Fagin. 

'None,' replied the ******** of the ********; for it was he. 'He won't **** till it's all safe.  ****** on it, they're on the ***** down there; and that if he moved, he'd blow upon the thing at once.  He's all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him.  I'll pound it, that ******'* ******** ********. Let him alone for that.' 

'Will _he_ be here to-night?' asked the Jew, laying the same ******** on the ******* as before. 

'Monks, do you mean?' inquired the ********, **********. 

'Hush!' said the Jew.  'Yes.' 

'Certain,' replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his ***; 'I expected him here before now.  If you'll **** ten minutes, he'll be--' 

'No, no,' said the Jew, hastily; as though, however ******** he might be to see the person in question, he was ************ ******** by his *******.  'Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me to-night.  No, say to-morrow.  As he is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.' 

'Good!' said the man.  'Nothing more?' 

'Not a word now,' said the Jew, ********** the stairs. 

'I say,' said the other, looking over the *****, and speaking in a ****** whisper; 'what a time this would be for a ****!  I've got **** ****** here: so *****, that a boy might take him!' 

'Ah!  But it's not **** ******'* time,' said the Jew, looking up. 

'**** has something more to do, before we can ****** to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to **** merry *****--_***** they last_.  Ha! ha! ha!' 

The ******** ************ the old man's laugh; and returned to his ******.  The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of ******* and thought.  After a brief **********, he called a ****-*********, and **** the man ***** towards ******* Green. He ********* him within some quarter of a **** of Mr. *****'* *********, and ********* the short ********* of the distance, on foot. 

'Now,' muttered the Jew, as he ******* at the door, 'if there is any deep **** here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, ******* as you 



She was in her room, the woman said.  Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ********.  The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair ********** over it. 

'She has been ********,' thought the Jew, *****, 'or perhaps she is only *********.' 

The old man turned to close the door, as he made this **********; the noise thus **********, roused the girl.  She **** his ****** face ********, as she inquired to his ******* of Toby *******'* story.  When it was *********, she **** into her former attitude, but spoke not a word.  She ****** the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she ********** changed her position, ******** her feet upon the ground; but this was all. 

During the silence, the Jew looked ********** about the room, as if to ****** himself that there were no *********** of Sikes having ******** returned.  Apparently ********* with his **********, he ******* twice or ******, and made as many ******* to open a conversation; but the girl ****** him no more than if he had been made of stone.  At length he made another *******; and ******* his hands together, said, in his most ************ tone, 

'And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?' 

The girl ****** out some half ************ reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the ********* noise that ******* her, to be 



'And the boy, too,' said the Jew, ********* his eyes to ***** a ******* of her face.  'Poor ****** child!  Left in a ditch, *****; only think!' 

'The child,' said the girl, suddenly looking up, 'is better where he is, than among us; and if no **** comes to Bill from it, I hope he **** dead in the ditch and that his young ***** may *** there.' 

'What!' cried the Jew, in *********. 

'**, I do,' returned the girl, ******* his ****.  'I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the ***** is over.  I can't bear to have him about me.  The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.' 

'****!' said the Jew, **********.  'You're *****.' 

'Am I?' cried the girl ********.  'It's no ***** of *****, if I am not! ***'* never have me anything else, if you had your will, except ***;--*** ****** *****'* suit you, *****'* it?' 

'No!' rejoined the Jew, *********.  'It does not.' 

'Change it, then!' ********* the girl, with a laugh. 

'Change it!' exclaimed the Jew, *********** beyond all ****** by his companion's ********** *********, and the ******** of the night, 'I _will_ change it!  Listen to me, you ****.  Listen to me, who with six words, can ******** Sikes as ****** as if I had his ****'* throat between my ******* now.  If he comes back, and ****** the boy behind him; if he **** off free, and dead or alive, ***** to ******* him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him ****** **** *****.  And do it the moment he **** foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too 



'What is all this?' cried the girl *************. 

'What is it?' pursued Fagin, mad with ****.  'When the boy's worth ******** of pounds to me, am I to lose what ****** threw me in the way of ******* ******, through the ***** of a ******* **** that I could ******* away the ***** of!  And me *****, too, to a born devil that only ***** the will, and has the power to, to--' 

******* for breath, the old man ********* for a word; and in that instant ******* the ******* of his *****, and changed his whole *********.  A moment before, his ******** hands had ******* the air; his eyes had *******; and his face ***** ***** with passion; but now, he ****** into a chair, and, ******** together, ******** with the ************ of having himself ********* some ****** ********.  After a short silence, he ******** to look round at his companion.  He appeared ******** *********, on ********* her in the same ******** attitude from which he had first roused her. 

'Nancy, dear!' ******* the Jew, in his usual voice.  'Did you mind me, 



'Don't ***** me now, Fagin!' replied the girl, raising her head *********.  'If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a good *** for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can't he won't; so no more about that.' 

'********* this boy, my dear?' said the Jew, ******* the ***** of his hands ********* together. 

'The boy must take his ****** with the rest,' *********** Nancy, hastily; 'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of ****'* way, and out of *****,--**** is, if Bill comes to no ****.  And if Toby got clear off, ****'* pretty sure to be safe; for ****'* worth two of Toby any time.' 

'And about what I was saying, my dear?' observed the Jew, ******* his ********** eye ******** upon her. 

'Your must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,' rejoined Nancy; 'and if it is, you had better **** till to-morrow.  You put me up for a minute; but now I'm ****** again.' 

Fagin put several other *********: all with the same ***** of ************ whether the girl had ******** by his ********* *****; but, she answered them so *******, and was ****** so ******* ******* by his ********* looks, that his ******** ********** of her being more than a ****** in ******, was *********.  Nancy, indeed, was not ****** from a ******* which was very common among the Jew's female ******; and in which, in their ******** years, they were rather ********** than *******. Her ********** appearance, and a ********* ******* of ****** which ******** the *********, ******** strong ************ ******** of the justice of the Jew's ***********; and when, after ********* in the ********* ******* of violence above *********, she ********, first into ********, and afterwards into a ******** of feelings: under the ********* of which she **** tears one minute, and in the next gave ********* to various ************ of 'Never say die!' and ****** ************ as to what might be the ****** of the **** so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had ************ ********** of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed. 

Having ***** his mind by this *********; and having ************ his ******* object of ********* to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ************, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face ********: leaving his young friend ******, with her head upon the table. 

It was within an hour of ********.  The ******* being dark, and ******** cold, he had no great ********** to ******.  The sharp wind that ******* the streets, seemed to have ******* them of **********, as of **** and ***, for few people were ******, and they were to all appearance ********* fast home. It **** from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and *********, as every fresh **** ***** him ****** on his way. 

He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already ******** in his pocket for the ****-***, when a dark ****** ******* from a ********** ******** which lay in deep ******, and, ******** the road, ****** up to him ***********. 

'Fagin!' whispered a voice close to his ear. 

'Ah!' said the Jew, turning quickly round, 'is that--' 

'Yes!' *********** the stranger.  'I have been ********* here these two hours.  Where the devil have you been?' 

'On your business, my dear,' replied the Jew, glancing ******** at his companion, and ********** his pace as he spoke.  'On your business all 



'Oh, of course!' said the stranger, with a *****.  'Well; and what's come of it?' 

'Nothing good,' said the Jew. 

'Nothing bad, I hope?' said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a ******** look on his companion. 

The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, ************ him, ******** to the house, before which they had by this time arrived:  *********, that he had better say what he had got to say, under *****:  for his blood was ******* with standing about so long, and the wind **** through him. 

Fagin looked as if he could have ********* ******* himself from taking home a ******* at that ************ hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion ********* his ******* in a ********** manner, he ******** the door, and ********* him to close it softly, while he got a light. 

'It's as dark as the grave,' said the man, ******* forward a few steps. 'Make *****!' 

'Shut the door,' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise. 

'That wasn't my doing,' said the other man, feeling his way. 'The wind **** it to, or it shut of its own ******: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall ***** my ****** out against something in this ********** ****.' 

Fagin ********** ********* the kitchen stairs.  After a short *******, he returned with a ******* candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was ****** in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.  ********* the man to follow him, he led the way 



'We can say the few words **'** got to say in here, my dear,' said the Jew, ******** open a door on the first floor; 'and as there are ***** in the ********, and we never show ****** to our **********, we'll set the candle on the stairs.  There!' 

With those words, the Jew, ******** down, placed the candle on an ***** ****** of stairs, ******* opposite to the room door.  This done, he led the way into the *********; which was ********* of all ******** save a broken ***-*****, and an old ***** or **** without ********, which stood behind the door.  Upon this piece of *********, the stranger sat himself with the air of a ***** man; and the Jew, drawing up the ***-***** opposite, they sat face to face.  It was not quite dark; the door was ********* open; and the candle outside, threw a ****** ********** on the opposite wall. 

They ********* for some time in ********.  Though nothing of the conversation was *************** beyond a few ********** words here and there, a ******** might ****** have ********* that Fagin appeared to be ********* himself against some ******* of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of ************ **********.  They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when *****--** which name the Jew had ********** the strange man several times in the course of their ********--****, raising his voice a little, 

'I tell you again, it was ***** *******.  Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a ********, ********** ********** of him at 



'Only hear him!' exclaimed the Jew, ********* his shoulders. 

'Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had ******?' demanded Monks, *******.  'Haven't you done it, with other boys, ****** of times?  If you had had ******** for a ***********, at most, couldn't you have got him *********, and sent ****** out of the *******; perhaps for life?' 

'Whose turn would that have ******, my dear?' inquired the Jew ******. 

'Mine,' replied Monks. 

'But not mine,' said the Jew, ************.  'He might have become of use to me.  When there are two ******* to a *******, it is only ********** that the ********* of both should be *********; is it, my good friend?' 

'What then?' demanded Monks. 

'I saw it was not **** to ***** him to the business,' replied the Jew; 'he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.' 

'***** him, no!' muttered the man, 'or he would have been a thief, long 



'I had no hold upon him to make him worse,' pursued the Jew, ********* watching the countenance of his companion.  'His hand was not in.  I had nothing to ******** him with; which we always must have in the *********, or we ****** in ****.  What could I do?  Send him out with the Dodger and Charley?  We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I ******** for us all.' 

'_That_ was not my doing,' observed Monks. 

'No, no, my dear!' ******* the Jew.  'And I don't ******* with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have ******* eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the ********* that it was him you were looking for.  Well!  I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ ****** to ****** him.' 

'******** the girl!' said Monks, impatiently. 

'Why, we can't ****** to do that just now, my dear,' replied the Jew, smiling; 'and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done.  I know what these ***** are, Monks, well.  As soon as the boy ****** to ******, ***'** care no more for him, than for a ***** of ****.  You want him made a thief.  If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, **--**--' said the Jew, drawing ****** to the *****,--'**'* not ******, ****,--*** if the ***** comes to the *****, and he is dead--' 

'It's no ***** of mine if he is!' interposed the other man, with a look of ******, and ******** the Jew's arm with trembling hands.  'Mind that.  Fagin!  I had no hand in it.  Anything but his death, I told you from the first.  I won't **** blood; it's always found out, and ****** a man besides.  If they **** him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?  Fire this ******** ***!  What's that?' 

'What!' cried the Jew, ******** the ****** round the body, with both arms, as he ****** to his feet.  'Where?' 

'******! replied the man, ******* at the opposite wall.  'The ******! I saw the ****** of a woman, in a ***** and ******, **** along the ******** like a breath!' 

The Jew ******** his hold, and they ****** ************ from the room. The candle, ****** by the *******, was standing where it had been placed.  It showed them only the empty *********, and their own white faces.  They listened ********:  a ******** silence ******* ********** the house. 

'It's your *****,' said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his 



'I'll ***** I saw it!' replied Monks, trembling.  'It was ******* forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it ****** away.' 

The Jew ******* ************** at the pale face of his *********, and, ******* him he could follow, if he *******, ******** the stairs.  They looked into all the *****; they were cold, ****, and empty.  They ********* into the passage, and ****** into the ******* below.  The green **** hung upon the low walls; the ****** of the ***** and **** ********* in the light of the candle; but all was still as death. 

'What do you think now?' said the Jew, when they had ******** the passage.  'Besides *********, there's not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they're safe enough. See here!' 

As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two **** from his pocket; and *********, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to ******* any ********* on the **********. 

This *********** ********* *********** ********* Mr. Monks. His ************* had gradually become less and less ******** as they proceeded in their ****** without making any *********; and, now, he gave **** to several very **** ******, and ********* it could only have been his ******* ***********.  He ******** any ******* of the conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly *********** that it was past one o'clock.  And so the ******* couple ******. 





CHAPTER ***** 

****** FOR THE ************ OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH ******** A LADY, MOST *************** 

As it would be, by no means, ****** in a ****** ****** to keep so ****** a ********* as a beadle *******, with his back to the fire, and the ****** of his coat ******** up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to ******* him; and as it would still less become his *******, or his ********* to ******* in the same ******* a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of ********** and *********, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well ****** the ***** of **** or matron of ********** ******; the ********* whose *** ****** these *****--******** that he knows his place, and that he ********** a ******** ********* for those upon earth to whom high and ********* ********* is *********--******* to pay them that ******* which their position *******, and to ***** them with all that ******* ******** which their ******* ****, and (by ***********) great *******, ************ ***** at his hands.  Towards this end, indeed, he had ******** to *********, in this place, a ************ ******** the ****** right of *******, and *********** of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:  which could not **** to have been both *********** and ********** to the *****-****** ****** but which he is ************* *********, by want of time and space, to ******** to some more ********** and ******* opportunity; on the ******* of which, he will be ******** to show, that a beadle ******** ***********:  that is to say, a ********* beadle, ******** to a ********* workhouse, and ********* in his ******** ******** the ********* church:  is, in right and ****** of his office, ********* of all the *********** and best ********* of ********; and that to none of those ***********, can mere *********' *******, or *****-**-*** *******, or even ******-**-**** ******* (save the last, and they in a very ***** and ******** ******), lay the ******** *********** *****. 

Mr. Bumble had **-******* the *********, **-******* the *****-*****, made a ****** ********** of the ****-***, and *********** to a ****** the ***** condition of the *********, down to the very *****-**** ***** of the ******; and had repeated each ******* full half a ***** times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking ****** thinking; as there were no ****** of Mrs. ******'* ********, it ******* to Mr. Bumble that it would be an ******** and ******** way of ******** the time, if he were further to ***** his ********** by a ******* glance at the ******** of Mrs. ******'* ***** of *******. 

Having listened at the *******, to ****** himself that nobody was *********** the *******, Mr. Bumble, ********* at the ******, proceeded to make himself ********** with the ******** of the three long *******: which, being filled with various ******** of good ******* and *******, carefully ********* between two ****** of old **********, ******** with ***** ********: seemed to ***** him ********* satisfaction.  ********, in course of time, at the *****-**** corner ****** (in which was the key), and ********* ******* a small ********* box, which, being ******, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the ******** of ****, Mr. Bumble returned with a ******* walk to the *********; and, ******** his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, 'I'll do it!' He followed up this ********** ***********, by shaking his head in a ******* manner for ten minutes, as though he were ************* with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in *******, with much ******* pleasure and interest. 

He was still ******** ******* in this latter ******, when Mrs. Corney, ******** into the room, threw herself, in a ********** state, on a chair by the ********, and ******** her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and ****** for breath. 

'Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, ******** over the matron, 'what is this, ma'am?  Has anything happened, ma'am?  Pray answer me: I'm **--**--' Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word '***********,' so he said 'broken *******.' 

'Oh, Mr. Bumble!' cried the lady, 'I have been so ********** put out!' 

'Put out, ma'am!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble; 'who has ***** to--?  I know!' said Mr. Bumble, ******** himself, with ****** *******, 'this is them ******* paupers!' 

'It's dreadful to think of!' said the lady, **********. 

'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. 

'I can't help it,' ********* the lady. 

'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble **********.  'A little of the ****?' 

'Not for the world!' replied Mrs. Corney.  'I ******'*,--**!  The top ***** in the *****-**** ******--**!'  ******** these words, the good lady pointed, ************, to the ********, and ********* a ********** from ******** ******.  Mr. Bumble ****** to the ******; and, ********* a **** *****-***** ****** from the ***** thus ************ *********, filled a ***-*** with its ********, and held it to the ****'* lips. 

'I'm better now,' said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after ******** half of it. 

Mr. Bumble raised his eyes ******* to the ******* in ************; and, ******** them down again to the **** of the ***, ****** it to his nose. 

'**********,' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a ***** voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke.  '*** it!  There's a ******--* little something else in it.' 

Mr. Bumble ****** the ******** with a ******** look; ******* his lips; took another *****; and put the *** down empty. 

'It's very **********,' said Mrs. Corney. 

'Very much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadle.  As he spoke, he drew a chair ****** the matron, and ******** inquired what had happened to ******** her. 

'Nothing,' replied Mrs. Corney.  'I am a *******, *********, weak 



'Not weak, ma'am,' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little ******.  'Are you a weak *******, Mrs. Corney?' 

'We are all weak ********,' said Mrs. Corney, laying down a ******* 



'So we are,' said the beadle. 

Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the ********** of that time, Mr. Bumble had *********** the position by ******** his left arm from the back of Mrs. ******'* chair, where it had ********** ******, to Mrs. ******'* *****-******, round which it gradually became ********. 

'We are all weak ********,' said Mr. Bumble. 

Mrs. Corney ******. 

'Don't ****, Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble. 

'I can't help it,' said Mrs. Corney.  And she ****** again. 

'This is a very *********** room, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble looking round.  'Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a ******** thing.' 

'It would be too much for one,' ******** the lady. 

'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in **** *******. 'Eh, Mrs. Corney?' 

Mrs. Corney ******* her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle ******* his, to get a view of Mrs. ******'* face.  Mrs. Corney, with great *********, turned her head away, and ******** her hand to get at her ******-************; but ********** ******** it in that of Mr. 



'The board ****** you *****, don't they, Mrs. Corney?' inquired the beadle, ************** ******** her hand. 

'And *******,' replied Mrs. Corney, ******** ********* the ********. 

'*****, *******, and *****-**** free,' said Mr. Bumble.  'Oh, Mrs. Corney, what an ***** you are!' 

The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.  She **** into Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his *********, ********* a ********** **** upon her ****** nose. 

'Such porochial **********!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, ***********. 'You know that Mr. ***** is worse to-night, my **********?' 

'Yes,' replied Mrs. Corney, *********. 

'He can't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued Mr. Bumble. 'He is the master of this *************; his death will cause a *******; that ******* must be filled up.  Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a ******** this *****!  What a opportunity for a ****** of ****** and *************!' 

Mrs. Corney ******. 

'The little word?' said Mr. Bumble, ******* over the ******* ******. 'The one little, little, little word, my ******* Corney?' 

'**--**--***!' ****** out the matron. 

'One more,' pursued the beadle; '******* your ******* feelings for only one more.  When is it to come off?' 

Mrs. Corney twice ******* to speak:  and twice ******.  At length ********* up *******, she threw her arms ****** Mr. Bumble's neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he *******, and that he was 'a ************ ****.' 

Matters being thus ******** and ************** ********, the ******** was ******** ******** in another ********* of the ********** *******; which was rendered the more necessary, by the ******* and ********* of the ****'* spirits.  While it was being disposed of, she ********** Mr. Bumble with the old *****'* *******. 

'Very good,' said that gentleman, ******* his **********; 'I'll call at **********'* as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning.  Was it that as frightened you, love?' 

'It wasn't anything particular, dear,' said the lady *********. 

'It must have been something, love,' ***** Mr. Bumble. 'Won't you tell your own *.?' 

'Not now,' rejoined the lady; 'one of these days.  After we're *******, 



'After we're *******!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble.  'It wasn't any ********* from any of them **** paupers as--' 

'No, no, love!' interposed the lady, hastily. 

'If I thought it was,' continued Mr. Bumble; 'if I thought as any one of 'em had ***** to **** his ****** eyes to that ****** countenance--' 

'They wouldn't have ***** to do it, love,' ********* the lady. 

'They had better not!' said Mr. Bumble, ********* his ****. 'Let me see any man, porochial or *****-*********, as would ******* to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn't do it a second time!' 

************* by any violence of *************, this might have seemed no very high ********** to the ****'* ******; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the ****** with many ******* ********, she was much ******* with this proof of his ********, and *********, with great **********, that he was indeed a ****. 

The **** then turned up his ****-******, and put on his cocked hat; and, having ********* a long and ************ ******* with his ****** *******, once again ****** the cold wind of the night: merely *******, for a few minutes, in the **** paupers' ****, to ***** them a little, with the view of ********** himself that he could **** the office of *********-****** with ******* ********. ******* of his **************, Mr. Bumble left the ******** with a light heart, and bright ******* of his ****** *********:  which ****** to ****** his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker. 

Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and ******: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a ******* ****** of ******** ******** than is necessary to a ********** *********** of the two ********* of ****** and ********, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of ********-**.  Mr. Bumble ****** with his cane on the ******* several times; but, ********** no attention, and ********* a light ******* through the *****-****** of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made **** to **** in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little *********. 

The ***** was laid for ******; the table was covered with bread and ******, ****** and *******; a ******-*** and a ****-******. At the ***** end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole ****** *********** in an ****-*****, with his legs ****** over one of the arms: an open *****-***** in one hand, and a **** of ******** bread in the other. Close ****** him stood Charlotte, opening ******* from a ******: which Mr. Claypole ************ to *******, with ********** *******.  A more than ******** ******* in the ****** of the young gentleman's nose, and a kind of fixed **** in his right eye, ******* that he was in a slight ****** ***********; these ******** were ********* by the ******* ****** with which he took his *******, for which nothing but a strong ************ of their ******* **********, in ***** of ******** fever, could have ************ *********. 

'Here's a ********* *** one, Noah, dear!' said Charlotte; '*** him, do; only this one.' 

'What a ********* thing is a ******!' ******** Mr. Claypole, after he had ********* it.  'What a pity it is, a number of 'em should ever make you feel *************; isn't it, Charlotte?' 

'It's quite a *******,' said Charlotte. 

'So it is,' ********** Mr. Claypole. '**'* yer **** of *******?' 

'Not ********,' replied Charlotte.  'I like to see you eat 'em, Noah dear, better than ****** 'em myself.' 

'***!' said Noah, ************; 'how *****!' 

'Have another,' said Charlotte.  'Here's one with such a beautiful, ******** *****!' 

'I can't ****** any more,' said Noah.  'I'm very *****.  Come here, Charlotte, and I'll **** yer.' 

'What!' said Mr. Bumble, ******** into the room.  'Say that again, sir.' 

Charlotte uttered a ******, and *** her face in her *****.  Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than ********* his legs to ***** the ground, ***** at the beadle in ******* 



'Say it again, you ****, ********* fellow!' said Mr. Bumble. 'How **** you ******* such a thing, sir?  And how **** you ********* him, you ******** ****?  **** her!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong ***********. 



'I didn't mean to do it!' said Noah, **********.  'She's always *-******* of me, whether I like it, or not.' 

'Oh, Noah,' cried Charlotte, *************. 

'Yer are; yer know yer are!' retorted Noah.  'She's always *-****' of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she ****** me under the ****, please, sir; and ***** all manner of love!' 

'Silence!' cried Mr. Bumble, *******.  'Take yourself downstairs, ma'am.  Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your *****; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old *****'* ***** after ********* to-morrow morning.  Do you hear sir?  *******!' cried Mr. Bumble, ******* up his hands.  'The *** and ********** of the lower ****** in this porochial ******** is *********!  If ********** don't take their ********** ******* under consideration, this *******'* ******, and the ********* of the ********* gone for ever!'  With these words, the beadle ******, with a ***** and gloomy air, from the **********'* 



And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary ************ for the old *****'* *******, let us set on foot a few ******** after young Oliver Twist, and ********* whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him. 





CHAPTER ****** 

LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND ******** WITH HIS ********** 

'****** **** your *******!' muttered Sikes, ******** his teeth. 'I wish I was among some of you; ***'* **** the ******* for it.' 

As Sikes growled forth this ***********, with the most desperate ******** that his desperate nature was ******* of, he ****** the body of the ******* boy across his ****** ****; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his ********. 

There was little to be made out, in the **** and darkness; but the loud ******** of men ******** through the air, and the ******* of the ************ dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, ********* in every direction. 

'Stop, you *****-******* *****!' cried the robber, ******** after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already *****. 



The ********** of the word, brought Toby to a dead *****-*****. For he was not quite ********* that he was beyond the ***** of ******-****; and Sikes was in no **** to be ****** with. 

'Bear a hand with the boy,' cried Sikes, ********* ********* to his ***********.  'Come back!' 

Toby made a show of *********; but ********, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to ******** ************ ********** as he came slowly 



'*******!' cried Sikes, laying the boy in a *** ditch at his feet, and drawing a ****** from his pocket.  'Don't **** ***** with me.' 

At this moment the noise grew ******.  Sikes, again looking round, could ******* that the men who had given ***** were already ******** the gate of the ***** in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some ***** in ******* of them. 

'It's all up, Bill!' cried Toby; 'drop the ***, and show 'em your *****.'  With this ******* ******, Mr. Crackit, ********** the ****** of being **** by his friend, to the ********* of being taken by his *******, ****** turned ****, and ****** off at full *****.  Sikes ******** his teeth; took one look ******; threw over the ********* form of Oliver, the **** in which he had been ********* *******; ran along the front of the *****, as if to ******** the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another ***** which *** it at right ******; and ******** his ****** high into the air, ******* it at a *****, and was gone. 

'**, **, there!' cried a ********* voice in the ****. '*******! *******!  Come here, come here!' 

The dogs, who, in common with their *******, seemed to have no particular ****** for the ***** in which they were *******, ******* answered to the *******.  Three men, who had by this time ******** some distance into the *****, stopped to take ******* together. 

'My ******, or, *********, I should say, my _******_, is,' said the ******* man of the party, 'that we '********* go home again.' 

'I am ********* to anything which is ********* to Mr. Giles,' said a ******* man; who was by no means of a **** ******, and who was very pale in the face, and very ******: as frightened men ********** are. 

'I *******'* wish to ****** ***-********, gentlemen,' said the *****, who had called the dogs back, 'Mr. Giles ought to know.' 

'Certainly,' replied the ******* man; 'and ******** Mr. Giles says, it isn't our place to ********** him.  No, no, I know my **********! Thank my *****, I know my **********.'  To tell the truth, the little man _did_ **** to know his *********, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a ********* one; for his teeth ********* in his head as he spoke. 

'You are afraid, Brittles,' said Mr. Giles. 

'I **'*,' said Brittles. 

'You are,' said Giles. 

'You're a *********, Mr. Giles,' said Brittles. 

'You're a lie, Brittles,' said Mr. Giles. 

Now, these four ******* ***** from Mr. *****'* *****; and Mr. *****'* ***** had ****** from his *********** at having the ************** of going home again, ******* upon himself under ***** of a **********. The ***** man brought the ******* to a close, most ***************. 

'I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,' said he, 'we're all afraid.' 

'Speak for yourself, sir,' said Mr. Giles, who was the ****** of the 



'So I do,' replied the man.  'It's ******* and ****** to be afraid, under such circumstances.  I am.' 

'So am I,' said Brittles; 'only there's no call to tell a man he is, so 



These ***** ********** ******** Mr. Giles, who at once ***** that _he_ was afraid; upon which, they all three ***** about, and ran back again with the ********** *********, until Mr. Giles (who had the ******** wind of the party, as was ********** with a *********) most ********** ******** on stopping, to make an ******* for his ********* of ******. 

'But it's *********,' said Mr. Giles, when he had *********, 'what a man will do, when his blood is up.  I should have ********* ******--* know I ******--** **'* caught one of them *******.' 

As the other two were ********* with a ******* ************; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some *********** ****** upon the cause of this sudden change in their ***********. 

'I know what it was,' said Mr. Giles; 'it was the gate.' 

'I *******'* wonder if it was,' exclaimed Brittles, catching at the 



'You may ****** upon it,' said Giles, 'that that gate stopped the **** of the **********.  I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was ******** over it.' 

By a ********** ***********, the other two had been ******* with the same ********** ********* at that ******* moment.  It was quite *******, *********, that it was the gate; ********** as there was no doubt ********* the time at which the change had taken place, because all three ********** that they had come in sight of the ******* at the instant of its *********. 

This ******** was held between the two men who had ********* the ********, and a ********** ****** who had been ******** in an ********, and who had been roused, together with his two ******* ****, to **** in the *******.  Mr. Giles ***** in the ****** ******** of ****** and ******* to the old lady of the *******; Brittles was a lad of ***-****: who, having entered her ******* a mere child, was ******* as a ********* young boy still, though he was something past ******. 

*********** each other with such ******** as this; but, ******* very close together, ***************, and looking ************** round, ******** a fresh **** ******* through the ******; the three men hurried back to a ****, behind which they had left their lantern, **** its light should ****** the ******* in what direction to fire.  Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round ****; and long after their ***** ***** had ****** to be ***********, the light might have been seen ********* and ******* in the distance, like some ********** of the **** and gloomy ********** through which it was ******* *****. 

The air grew ******, as day came slowly on; and the **** ****** along the ground like a ***** ***** of *****.  The ***** was ***; the ********, and low ******, were all **** and water; the **** breath of an *********** wind went ********* by, with a ****** *******.  Still, Oliver lay ********** and ********** on the spot where Sikes had left 



Morning drew on *****.  The air become more sharp and ********, as its first **** ***--*** death of night, rather than the birth of ***--********* ******* in the ***.  The ******* which had looked *** and ******** in the darkness, grew more and more *******, and gradually resolved into their ******** ******.  The rain came down, thick and fast, and ******** ******* among the ******** ******.  But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay *********, ******** and ***********, on his bed of ****. 

At length, a low cry of pain ***** the ********* that *********; and ******** it, the boy *****.  His left arm, ****** ******** in a *****, hung heavy and ******* at his side; the ******* was ********* with blood.  He was so weak, that he could scarcely ***** himself into a sitting *******; when he had done so, he looked ****** round for help, and ******* with pain.  Trembling in every *****, from cold and **********, he made an effort to stand *******; but, ********** from head to foot, fell ********* on the ground. 

After a short return of the ****** in which he had been so long *******, Oliver:  ***** by a ******** ******** at his heart, which seemed to **** him that if he lay there, he must ****** die:  got upon his feet, and ******* to walk. His head was *****, and he ********* to and fro like a ******* man.  But he kept up, ************, and, with his head ******** ********* on his breast, went ********* ******, he knew not *******. 

And now, ***** of *********** and ******** ***** came ******** on his mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were ******* *********--*** the very words they said, ******* in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, ******** on as on the previous day; and as ******* people passed them, he felt the ******'* ***** upon his *****. Suddenly, he started back at the ****** of ********; there rose into the air, loud ***** and ******; ****** ******* before his eyes; all was noise and ******, as some ****** hand **** him ********* away.  Through all these ***** *******, there ran an *********, ****** ************* of pain, which ******* and ********* him ***********. 

Thus he ********* on, ********, almost ************, between the **** of *****, or through *****-**** as they came in his way, until he reached a road.  Here the rain began to **** so *******, that it roused 



He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could *****.  ******* his condition, they might have ********** on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near ***** ******, than in the ****** open fields.  He ******** up all his strength for one last *****, and **** his ********* steps towards it. 

As he drew ****** to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before.  He ********** nothing of its *******; but the ***** and ****** of the ******** seemed ******** to him. 

That ****** wall!  On the ***** inside, he had ****** on his knees last night, and ****** the two ***'* mercy.  It was the very house they had ********* to ***. 

Oliver felt such fear come over him when he ********** the place, that, for the instant, he ****** the ***** of his *****, and thought only of ******.  ******!  He could scarcely stand:  and if he were in full ********** of all the best ****** of his slight and ******** *****, ******* could he ***?  He ****** against the ******-****; it was ********, and ***** open on its ******.  He ******** across the ****; ******* the steps; ******* ******* at the door; and, his whole strength ******* him, **** down against one of the ******* of the little *******. 

It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the ******, were ********** themselves, after the ******** and ******* of the night, with tea and ********, in the kitchen.  Not that it was Mr. *****'* ***** to ***** to too great *********** the ******* ********: towards whom it was rather his wont to ****** himself with a ***** **********, which, while it *********, could not **** to ****** them of his ******** position in society.  But, death, *****, and ********, make all men ******; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs ********* out before the kitchen ******, ******* his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he *********** a ************** and minute account of the robbery, to which his ******* (but ********** the **** and *********, who were of the party) listened with ********** interest. 

'It was about ****-**** two,' said Mr. Giles, 'or I wouldn't ***** that it ******'* have been a little ****** three, when I **** up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and ****** the corner of the *****-***** over him to ******* ***-*******,) I ******* I ***** a noise.' 

At this point of the ********* the **** turned pale, and asked the ********* to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the ******, who ********* not to hear. 

'--***** a noise,' continued Mr. Giles.  'I says, at first, "This is ********"; and was ********* myself off to sleep, when I ***** the noise again, ********.' 

'What sort of a noise?' asked the ****. 

'A kind of a ******* noise,' replied Mr. Giles, looking round him. 

'More like the noise of ********* a iron *** on a ******-******,' ********* Brittles. 

'It was, when _you_ ***** it, sir,' rejoined Mr. Giles; 'but, at this time, it had a ******* sound.  I turned down the clothes'; continued Giles, ******* back the *****-*****, 'sat up in bed; and listened.' 

The **** and ********* ************** ********** '***!' and drew their ****** ****** together. 

'I ***** it now, quite ********,' resumed Mr. Giles. '"Somebody," I says, "is ******* of a door, or window; what's to be done? I'll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being ******** in his bed; or his throat," I says, "may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it."' 

Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the *******, and ****** at him, with his mouth **** open, and his face ********** of the most *********** ******. 

'I ****** off the clothes,' said Giles, ******** away the *****-*****, and looking very hard at the **** and *********, 'got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of--' 

'Ladies present, Mr. Giles,' ******** the ******. 

'--Of _*****_, sir,' said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great ******** on the word; '****** the ****** ****** that always **** upstairs with the *****-******; and walked on ******* to his room. "Brittles," I says, when I had **** him, "don't be frightened!"' 

'So you did,' observed Brittles, in a low voice. 

'"We're dead men, I think, Brittles," I says,' continued Giles; '"but don't be frightened."' 

'_Was_ he frightened?' asked the ****. 

'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Giles.  'He was as ****--**! pretty near as **** as I was.' 

'I should have died at once, I'm sure, if it had been me,' observed the 



'You're a woman,' retorted Brittles, ******** up a little. 

'Brittles is right,' said Mr. Giles, ******* his head, ***********; 'from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle's ***, and ****** our way downstairs in the ***** ****,--** it might be so.' 

Mr. Giles had ***** from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to ********* his *********** with *********** action, when he started *********, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair.  The **** and ********* ********. 

'It was a *****,' said Mr. Giles, ******** ******* ********. 'Open the door, somebody.' 

Nobody moved. 

'It ***** a strange sort of a thing, a ***** coming at such a time in the morning,' said Mr. Giles, ********* the pale faces which ********** him, and looking very ***** himself; 'but the door must be opened.  Do you hear, somebody?' 

Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being ********* ******, ******** considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any *********** to him; at all ******, he ******** no reply. Mr. Giles ******** an ********* glance at the ******; but he had suddenly ****** ******.  The women were out of the 



'If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of *********,' said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, 'I am ready to make one.' 

'So am I,' said the ******, ****** up, as suddenly as he had ****** 



Brittles *********** on these *****; and the party being ******** **-******* by the ********* (made on ******** open the ********) that it was now ***** day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid to **** below, brought up the ****.  By the ****** of Mr. Giles, they all ****** very loud, to **** any ****-******** person outside, that they were strong in *******; and by a ******-***** of ******, *********** in the ***** of the same ********* gentleman, the dogs' ***** were well *******, in the ****, to make them **** ********. 

These *********** having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the ******'* arm (to ******* his running away, as he ********** said), and gave the word of ******* to open the door.  Brittles ******; the *****, ******* ********** over each other's shoulders, ****** no more ********** object than poor little Oliver Twist, ********** and *********, who raised his heavy eyes, and ****** ********* their 



'A boy!' exclaimed Mr. Giles, *********, ******* the ****** into the **********.  'What's the matter with ***--**?--***--********--**** ****--***'* you know?' 

Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry.  Mr. Giles, ******* the boy by one *** and one arm (*********** not the broken ****) ****** him straight into the ****, and ********* him at full length on the floor *******. 

'Here he is!' ****** Giles, ******* in a state of great **********, up the *********; 'here's one of the *******, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss! *******, miss!  I **** him, miss; and Brittles held the light.' 

'--In a lantern, miss,' cried Brittles, ******** one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might ****** the better. 

The two *****-******** ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had ******** a robber; and the ****** ****** himself in ************ to ******* Oliver, **** he should die before he could be ******.  In the ***** of all this noise and *********, there was heard a sweet female voice, which ******* it in an instant. 

'Giles!' whispered the voice from the *****-****. 

'I'm here, miss,' replied Mr. Giles.  'Don't be frightened, miss; I ain't much *******.  He didn't make a very desperate **********, miss! I was soon too many for him.' 

'Hush!' replied the young lady; 'you ******** my **** as much as the ******* did.  Is the poor creature much ****?' 

'******* desperate, miss,' replied Giles, with ************* 



'He looks as if he was *-*****, miss,' ****** Brittles, in the same manner as before.  'Wouldn't you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?' 

'Hush, pray; there's a good man!' rejoined the lady.  '**** ******* only one instant, while I speak to ****.' 

With a ******** as **** and gentle as the voice, the ******* ******* away.  She soon returned, with the direction that the ******* person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. *****'* room; and that Brittles was to ****** the **** and ****** himself ********* to ********:  from which place, he was to ********, with all *****, a ********* and doctor. 

'But won't you take one look at him, first, miss?' asked Mr. Giles, with as much ***** as if Oliver were some **** of **** *******, that he had ********* brought down.  'Not one little ****, miss?' 

'Not now, for the world,' replied the young lady.  'Poor fellow! Oh! ***** him ******, Giles for my sake!' 

The old ******* looked up at the *******, as she turned away, with a glance as ***** and ******** as if she had been his own child.  Then, ******* over Oliver, he ****** to carry him upstairs, with the care and ********** of a woman. 





CHAPTER **** 

HAS AN ************ ACCOUNT OF THE ******* OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER ******** 

In a ******** room:  though its ********* had rather the air of ***-********* *******, than of ****** ********:  there sat two ladies at a ****-****** *********-*****.  Mr. Giles, ******* with ********** care in a full suit of black, was in ********** upon them.  He had taken his ******* some ****-*** between the ****-***** and the *********-*****; and, with his body drawn up to its full ******, his head ****** back, and ******** the ****** ****** on one side, his left *** ********, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, ******** a ******, looked like one who ******** under a very ********* sense of his own ****** and **********. 

Of the two ladies, one was well ******** in years; but the ****-****** ***** chair in which she sat, was not more ******* than she.  ******* with the ****** ****** and *********, in a ****** ******* of **-**** *******, with some slight *********** to the ********** *****, which rather ****** to point the old ***** ********** than to ****** its effect, she sat, in a ******* manner, with her hands ****** on the table before her.  Her eyes (and age had ****** but little of their **********) were *********** upon her young companion. 

The ******* lady was in the ****** ***** and ******-**** of *********; at that age, when, if ever ****** be for ***'* good ******** ********* in ****** *****, they may be, without *******, supposed to ***** in such as ****. 

She was not past *********.  Cast in so slight and ********* a *****; so **** and gentle; so **** and beautiful; that earth seemed not her *******, nor its ***** ********* her fit companions.  The very intelligence that ***** in her deep **** eye, and was ******* upon her ***** head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the ******** expression of ********* and good ******, the ******** ****** that ****** about the face, and left no ****** there; above all, the smile, the ********, happy smile, were made for Home, and ******** ***** and happiness. 

She was ****** ******* in the little ******* of the table. ******** to ***** her eyes as the ***** lady was ********* her, she ********* put back her hair, which was ****** ******* on her ********; and threw into her ******* look, such an expression of ********* and ******* **********, that ******* spirits might have smiled to look upon her. 

'And Brittles has been gone ******* of an hour, has he?' asked the old lady, after a *****. 

'An hour and ****** minutes, ma'am,' replied Mr. Giles, ********* to a ****** watch, which he drew forth by a black ******. 

'He is always ****,' ******** the old lady. 

'Brittles always was a **** boy, ma'am,' replied the *********. And seeing, by the ***, that Brittles had been a **** boy for ******* of ****** years, there appeared no great *********** of his ever being a fast one. 

'He **** worse ******* of better, I think,' said the ***** lady. 

'It is very *********** in him if he ***** to **** with any other boys,' said the young lady, smiling. 

Mr. Giles was apparently *********** the ********* of ********* in a ********** smile himself, when a *** ***** up to the ******-****: out of which there ****** a *** gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, ******* quickly into the house by some ********** *******, burst into the room, and nearly ********** Mr. Giles and the *********-***** together. 

'I never heard of such a thing!' exclaimed the *** gentleman. 'My dear Mrs. ******--***** my ****--** the silence of the night, ***--* _never_ heard of such a thing!' 

With these *********** of **********, the *** gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found 



'You ought to be dead; ********** dead with the ******,' said the *** gentleman.  'Why didn't you send?  Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my ********* would have been *********; or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances.  Dear, dear!  So **********!  In the silence of the night, too!' 

The doctor seemed ********** ******** by the fact of the robbery having been **********, and ********* in the *****-****; as if it were the *********** ****** of gentlemen in the ************* way to ******** business at ****, and to make an ***********, by ****, a day or two 



'And you, Miss Rose,' said the doctor, turning to the young lady, 'I--' 

'Oh! very much so, indeed,' said Rose, ************ him; 'but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom **** ****** you to see.' 

'Ah! to be sure,' replied the doctor, 'so there is.  That was your *********, Giles, I understand.' 

Mr. Giles, who had been ********** putting the ***-**** to ******, ******* very red, and said that he had had that honour. 

'Honour, eh?' said the doctor; 'well, I don't know; perhaps it's as ********** to *** a thief in a back kitchen, as to *** your man at ****** *****.  ***** that he ***** in the air, and you've ****** a ****, Giles.' 

Mr. Giles, who thought this light ********* of the matter an ****** ******* at *********** his *****, answered ************, that it was not for the like of him to ***** about that; but he rather thought it was no **** to the opposite party. 

'***, that's true!' said the doctor.  'Where is he?  Show me the way. I'll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.  That's the little window that he got in at, eh?  Well, I couldn't have ******** it!' 

Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the ****** may be ********, that Mr. Losberne, a ******* in the *************, known through a ******* of ten miles round as 'the doctor,' had ***** ***, more from ****-****** than from good living:  and was as kind and ******, and ****** as ********* an old ********, as will be found in five times that space, by any ******** alive. 

The doctor was ******, much longer than either he or the ladies had ***********.  A large **** box was ******* out of the ***; and a ******* bell was **** very often; and the ******** ran up and down stairs ***********; from which ****** it was ****** ********* that something ********* was going on above.  At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his *******; looked very **********, and closed the door, carefully. 

'This is a very ************* thing, Mrs. Maylie,' said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut. 

'He is not in danger, I hope?' said the old lady. 

'Why, that would _not_ be an ************* thing, under the circumstances,' replied the doctor; 'though I don't think he is. Have you seen the thief?' 

'No,' rejoined the old lady. 

'Nor heard anything about him?' 





'I beg your ******, ma'am, interposed Mr. Giles; 'but I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.' 

The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the ******, that he had only **** a boy.  Such ************* had been ******** upon his *******, that he could not, for the life of him, help ********** the *********** for a few ********* minutes; during which he had **********, in the very ****** of a brief ********** for ********* *******. 

'Rose ****** to see the man,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'but I wouldn't hear of 



'*****!' rejoined the doctor.  'There is nothing very ******** in his appearance.  Have you any ********* to see him in my presence?' 

'If it be necessary,' replied the old lady, 'certainly not.' 

'Then I think it is necessary,' said the doctor; 'at all ******, I am quite sure that you would ****** ****** not having done so, if you ********* it.  He is perfectly quiet and *********** now. ***** **--**** Rose, will you ****** me?  Not the ********* fear, I ****** you my honour!' 





CHAPTER *** 

******* WHAT OLIVER'S NEW ******** THOUGHT OF HIM 

With many ********** ********** that they would be ********* ********* in the ****** of the ********, the doctor drew the young ****'* arm through one of his; and ******** his ********** hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ******** and ***********, upstairs. 

'Now,' said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the ****** of a *******-****, 'let us hear what you think of him.  He has not been ****** very ********, but he don't look at all ********* ***************.  Stop, though!  Let me first see that he is in ******** order.' 

******** before them, he looked into the room.  ********* them to *******, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the ******** of the bed.  Upon it, in **** of the ******, *****-******* ******* they had expected to ******, there lay a mere child:  **** with pain and **********, and **** into a deep sleep.  His ******* arm, ***** and ********** up, was crossed upon his breast; his head ******** upon the other arm, which was half ****** by his long hair, as it ******** over the ******. 

The ****** gentleman held the ******* in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.  ****** he was watching the ******* thus, the ******* lady ****** softly past, and ******* herself in a chair by the *******, ******** Oliver's hair from his face.  As she ******* over him, her tears fell upon his ********. 

The boy *******, and smiled in his sleep, as though these ***** of pity and ********** had awakened some pleasant ***** of a love and ********* he had never known.  Thus, a ****** of gentle *****, or the ******** of water in a silent place, or the ***** of a ******, or the ******* of a ******** word, will sometimes call up sudden *** ************ of ****** that never were, in this life; which ****** like a breath; which some brief ****** of a ******* *********, long gone by, would **** to have awakened; which no ********* ******** of the mind can ever ******. 

'What can this mean?' exclaimed the ***** lady.  'This poor child can never have been the ***** of *******!' 

'****,' said the *******, ********* the *******, '***** up her ***** in many *******; and who can say that a **** outside ***** not ******** 



'But at so early an age!' ***** Rose. 

'My dear young lady,' rejoined the *******, ********** shaking his head; '*****, like death, is not ******** to the old and ******** alone.  The ******** and ******* are too often its ****** *******.' 

'But, can ***--**! can you really believe that this ******** boy has been the ********* ********* of the ***** ******** of society?' said 



The ******* shook his head, in a manner which ********* that he ****** it was very possible; and ********* that they might ******* the *******, led the way into an ********* *********. 

'But even if he has been ******,' pursued Rose, 'think how young he is; think that he may never have known a ******'* love, or the ******* of a home; that ***-***** and *****, or the want of bread, may have ****** him to **** with men who have forced him to *****.  ****, dear ****, for *****'* sake, think of this, before you let them **** this sick child to a ******, which in any case must be the grave of all his ******* of *********.  Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of ******* in your goodness and *********, but that I might have done so, and might have been ******* ******** and *********** with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too 



'My dear love,' said the ***** lady, as she ****** the ******* girl to her *****, 'do you think I would **** a hair of his head?' 

'Oh, no!' replied Rose, eagerly. 

'No, ******,' said the old lady; 'my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be ***** to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?' 

'Let me think, ma'am,' said the doctor; 'let me think.' 

Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and ********* himself on his ****, and ******** ***********.  After various ************ of 'I've got it now' and 'no, I haven't,' and as many ******** of the walking and ********, he at length made a dead ****, and spoke as *******: 

'I think if you give me a full and ********* ********** to ***** Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can ****** it.  Giles is a ******** fellow and an old *******, I know; but you can make it up to him in a ******** ****, and ****** him for being such a good **** besides.  You don't object to that?' 

'Unless there is some other way of ********** the child,' replied Mrs. 



'There is no other,' said the doctor.  'No other, take my word for it.' 

'Then my **** ******* you with full power,' said Rose, smiling through her tears; 'but pray don't be ****** upon the poor ******* than is ************* necessary.' 

'You **** to think,' retorted the doctor, 'that ********* is disposed to be ****-******* **-***, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising **** *** *********, that you may be found in as ********** and ****-******* a **** by the first ******** young fellow who ******* to your **********; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might ***** myself, on the spot, of such a ********** opportunity for doing so, as the present.' 

'You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,' returned Rose, 



'Well,' said the doctor, ******** ********, 'that is no very ********* matter.  But to return to this boy.  The great point of our ********* is yet to come.  He will **** in an hour or so, I **** say; and although I have told that *****-****** *********-****** downstairs that he ****'* be moved or spoken to, on ***** of his life, I think we may ******** with him without danger.  Now I make this ***********--**** I shall ******* him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we *****, and I can show to the satisfaction of your **** reason, that he is a real and ******** bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his ****, without any ******* ************ on my part, at all ******.' 

'Oh no, ****!' ********* Rose. 

'Oh yes, ****!' said the doctor.  'Is is a *******?' 

'He cannot be ******** in ****,' said Rose; 'It is **********.' 

'Very good,' retorted the doctor; 'then so much the more reason for ******** to my ***********.' 

******* the ****** was entered into; and the ******* ********* sat down to ****, with some **********, until Oliver should *****. 

The ******** of the two ladies was ******** to ******* a longer ***** than Mr. Losberne had led them to ******; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver ********* *******.  It was evening, indeed, before the ****-******* doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length ************ ******** to be spoken to.  The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so ******** with ******* to ******** something, that he ****** it better to give him the opportunity, than to ****** upon his ********* quiet until next morning: which he should ********* have done. 

The ********** was a long one.  Oliver told them all his ****** history, and was often ********* to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a ****** thing, to hear, in the ******** room, the ****** voice of the sick child ********** a ***** ********* of ***** and ********** which hard men had brought upon him.  Oh! if when we ******* and ***** our ******-*********, we ******** but one thought on the dark ********* of ***** *****, which, like ***** and heavy ******, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less ******, to Heaven, to **** their *****-********* on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in ***********, the deep ********* of dead ***'* ******, which no power can ******, and no ***** shut out; where would be the ****** and *********, the *********, misery, *******, and wrong, that each day's life ****** with it! 

Oliver's ****** was ******** by gentle hands that night; and ********** and ****** watched him as he *****.  He felt **** and happy, and could have died without a ******. 

The ********* ********* was no sooner *********, and Oliver ******** to rest again, than the doctor, after ****** his eyes, and ********** them for being weak all at once, ****** himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles.  And finding nobody about the ********, it ******** to him, that he could perhaps ********* the *********** with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went. 

There were *********, in that lower house of the ******** **********, the *****-********, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the ****** (who had received a ******* ********** to ****** himself for the ********* of the day, in consideration of his ********), and the *********.  The latter gentleman had a large *****, a large head, large features, and large ****-*****; and he looked as if he had been taking a ************* ********* of ***--** indeed he had. 

The ********** of the previous night were still under **********; for Mr. Giles was *********** upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a *** of *** in his hand, was ************* everything, before his ******** said it. 

'Sit still!' said the doctor, ****** his hand. 

'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.  '****** ****** some *** to be given out, sir; and as I felt no **** ******** for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.' 

Brittles ****** a low ******, by which the ladies and gentlemen ********* were ********** to ******* the ************* they ******* from Mr. *****'* *************.  Mr. Giles looked round with a *********** air, as much as to say that so long as they ******* ********, he would never ****** them. 

'How is the ******* to-night, sir?' asked Giles. 

'**-**'; returned the doctor.  'I am afraid you have got yourself into a ****** there, Mr. Giles.' 

'I hope you don't mean to say, sir,' said Mr. Giles, trembling, 'that he's going to die.  If I thought it, I should never be happy again.  I wouldn't cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles here; not for all the ***** in the ******, sir.' 

'That's not the point,' said the doctor, ************.  'Mr. Giles, are you a **********?' 

'Yes, sir, I hope so,' ******** Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. 

'And what are _you_, boy?' said the doctor, turning ******* upon 



'**** bless me, sir!' replied Brittles, starting *********; 'I'm the same as Mr. Giles, sir.' 

'Then tell me this,' said the doctor, 'both of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon ********** to *****, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night?  Out with it!  Come!  We are ******** for you!' 

The doctor, who was *********** considered one of the ****-******** ********* on earth, made this ****** in such a dreadful tone of *****, that Giles and Brittles, who were ************ ******* by *** and **********, ****** at each other in a state of ************. 

'Pay attention to the reply, *********, will you?' said the doctor, shaking his ********** with great ********* of manner, and ******* the bridge of his nose with it, to ******* the ******** of that ******'* ****** *********. 'Something may come of this before long.' 

The ********* looked as **** as he could, and took up his ***** of office: which had been ********* ********** in the *******-******. 

'It's a ****** question of ********, you will *******,' said the doctor. 

'That's what it is, sir,' replied the *********, ******** with great violence; for he had ******** his *** in a *****, and some of it had gone the wrong way. 

'Here's the house broken into,' said the doctor, 'and a couple of men ***** one moment's ******* of a boy, in the ***** of ********* *****, and in all the *********** of alarm and darkness.  Here's a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he ******* to have his arm **** up, these men lay violent hands upon ***--** doing which, they place his life in great ******--*** ***** he is the thief.  Now, the question is, whether these men are ********* by the fact; if not, in what ********* do they place themselves?' 

The ********* nodded **********.  He said, if that wasn't ***, he would be glad to know what was. 

'I ask you again,' ********* the doctor, 'are you, on your ****** *****, able to ******** that boy?' 

Brittles looked ********** at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked ********** at Brittles; the ********* put his hand behind his ear, to ***** the reply; the two women and the ****** ****** forward to listen; the doctor ******* ****** round; when a **** was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of ******. 

'It's the *******!' cried Brittles, to all appearance much ********. 

'The what?' exclaimed the doctor, ****** in his turn. 

'The *** Street ********, sir,' replied Brittles, taking up a candle; 'me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.' 

'What?' cried the doctor. 

'Yes,' replied Brittles; 'I sent a ******* up by the ********, and I only wonder they *****'* here before, sir.' 

'You did, did you?  Then ******** ****--**** ******* down here; that's all,' said the doctor, walking away. 





CHAPTER **** 

******** A ******** POSITION 

'***'* that?' inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the ***** up, and ******* out, ******* the candle with his hand. 

'Open the door,' replied a man outside; 'it's the ******** from *** Street, as was sent to **-***.' 

Much ********* by this *********, Brittles opened the door to its full *****, and ********** a ****** man in a *****-****; who walked in, without saying anything more, and ***** his ***** on the ***, as ****** as if he ***** there. 

'Just send somebody out to ******* my ****, will you, young man?' said the officer; 'he's in the ***, *-******* the ****.  Have you got a coach 'us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?' 

Brittles ******** in the ***********, and pointing out the ********, the ****** man ******* back to the ******-****, and ****** his companion to put up the ***:  while Brittles ******* them, in a state of great **********.  This done, they returned to the house, and, being ***** into a parlour, took off their *****-***** and ****, and showed like what they were. 

The man who had ******* at the door, was a ***** ********* of ****** ******, **** about *****: with ***** black hair, ******* pretty close; ****-********, a round face, and sharp eyes.  The other was a ***-******, **** man, in ***-*****; with a rather ***-******** countenance, and a ******-** ********-******* nose. 

'Tell your ******** that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?' said the ******* man, ********* down his hair, and laying a pair of ********* on the table.  'Oh!  ****-*******, master.  Can I have a word or two with you in *******, if you please?' 

This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, ********* Brittles to ******, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door. 

'This is the lady of the house,' said Mr. Losberne, ********* towards Mrs. Maylie. 

Mr. Blathers made a ***.  Being ******* to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, ******** to Duff to do the same.  The latter gentleman, who did not ****** quite so much ********** to good society, or quite so much at his **** in **--*** of the ***--****** himself, after ********** several ******** ********** of the *****, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some *************. 

'Now, with ****** to this here robbery, master,' said Blathers. 'What are the circumstances?' 

Mr. Losberne, who appeared ******** of ******* time, ********* them at great length, and with much **************.  ******. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and ************ ********* a ***. 

'I can't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,' said Blathers; 'but my opinion at once **,--* don't mind ********** myself to that ******,--**** this wasn't done by a *****; eh, Duff?' 

'Certainly not,' replied Duff. 

'And, *********** the word ***** for the ******* of the ladies, I ********* your ******* to be, that this ******* was not made by a **********?' said Mr. Losberne, with a smile. 

'That's it, master,' replied Blathers.  'This is all about the robbery, is it?' 

'All,' replied the doctor. 

'Now, what is this, about this here boy that the ******** are *-******* on?' said Blathers. 

'Nothing at all,' replied the doctor.  'One of the frightened ******** ***** to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this ******* to ***** into the house; but it's ********: ***** *********.' 

'**** **** disposed of, if it is,' ******** Duff. 

'What he says is quite *******,' observed Blathers, ******* his head in a ************ way, and ******* ********** with the *********, as if they were a pair of *********.  'Who is the boy? What account does he give of himself?  Where did he come from? He didn't drop out of the ******, did he, master?' 

'Of course not,' replied the doctor, with a ******* glance at the two ladies.  'I know his whole history: but we can talk about that *********.  You would like, first, to see the place where the ******* made their *******, I suppose?' 

'Certainly,' rejoined Mr. Blathers.  'We had better ******* the ******** first, and ******* the ******** afterwards. That's the usual way of doing business.' 

****** were then ********; and ******. Blathers and Duff, ******** by the ****** *********, Brittles, Giles, and ********* else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the ****, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle ****** out to ******* the ******* with; and after that, a lantern to ***** the ********* with; and after that, a ********* to **** the ****** with.  This done, ****** the ********** interest of all *********, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a ************ ************** of their ***** in the previous *****'* **********: which they ********* some six times over: ************* each other, in not more than one ********* *******, the first time, and in not more than a ***** the last.  This ************ being arrived at, Blathers and Duff ******* the room, and held a long ******* together, ******** with which, for ******* and *********, a ************ of great ******* on the ********* point in ********, would be mere *****'* ****. 

Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very ****** state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces. 

'Upon my word,' he said, making a ****, after a great number of very ***** turns, 'I hardly know what to do.' 

'******,' said Rose, 'the poor *****'* story, ********** repeated to these men, will be ********** to ********* him.' 

'I doubt it, my dear young lady,' said the doctor, shaking his head. 'I don't think it would ********* him, either with them, or with ***** ************* of a ****** *****.  What is he, after all, they would say?  A *******.  ****** by mere ******* ************** and *************, his story is a very ******** one.' 

'You believe it, ******?' *********** Rose. 

'_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old **** for doing so,' rejoined the doctor; 'but I don't think it is ******* the **** for a ********* ******-*******, ************.' 

'Why not?' demanded Rose. 

'Because, my pretty *****-********,' replied the doctor: 'because, ****** with their eyes, there are many **** ****** about it; he can only ***** the ***** that look ill, and none of those that look well. ******** the *******, they _will_ have the why and the *********, and will take nothing for *******.  On his own *******, you see, he has been the companion of ******* for some time past; he has been carried to a ******-*******, on a ****** of ******* a gentleman's pocket; he has been taken away, ********, from that gentleman's house, to a place which he cannot ******** or point out, and of the ********* of which he has not the ******** ****.  He is brought down to ********, by men who **** to have taken a violent ***** to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to *** a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the *******, and so do the very thing that would set him all to ******, there ****** into the way, a ********** dog of a ****-**** ******, and ****** him! As if on purpose to ******* his doing any good for himself! Don't you see all this?' 

'I see it, of course,' replied Rose, smiling at the ******'* ***********; 'but still I do not see anything in it, to ********* the poor child.' 

'No,' replied the doctor; 'of course not!  Bless the bright eyes of your ***!  They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first ******** itself to them.' 

Having given **** to this ****** of **********, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even ******* ******** than before. 

'The more I think of it,' said the doctor, 'the more I see that it will occasion ******* trouble and ********** if we put these men in ********** of the boy's real story.  I am certain it will not be ********; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the ******** it forward, and giving ********* to all the ****** that will be cast upon it, must *********, **********, with your ********** **** of ******** him from misery.' 

'Oh! what is to be done?' cried Rose.  'Dear, dear! why did they send for these people?' 

'Why, indeed!' exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.  'I would not have had them here, for the world.' 

'All I know is,' said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind of desperate ********, 'that we must *** and carry it off with a **** face.  The object is a good one, and that must be our ******.  The boy has strong ******** of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be ****** to any more; that's one *******.  We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no ***** of ****.  Come in!' 

'Well, master,' said Blathers, ******** the room followed by his *********, and making the door fast, before he said any more. 'This ****'* a ***-** thing.' 

'And what the *****'* a ***-** thing?' demanded the doctor, impatiently. 

'We call it a ***-** robbery, ladies,' said Blathers, turning to them, as if he ****** their *********, but had a ******** for the ******'*, 'when the ******** is in it.' 

'Nobody ********* them, in this case,' said Mrs. Maylie. 

'**** ****** not, ma'am,' replied Blathers; 'but they might have been in it, for all that.' 

'More ****** on that **** account,' said Duff. 

'We find it was a town hand,' said Blathers, ********** his ******; 'for the ***** of work is *****-****.' 

'**** pretty indeed it is,' ******** Duff, in an *********. 

'There was two of 'em in it,' continued Blathers; 'and they had a boy with 'em; that's ***** from the **** of the window.  That's all to be said at present.  We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once, if you please.' 

'Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?' said the doctor: his face ***********, as if some new thought had ******** to him. 

'Oh! to be sure!' exclaimed Rose, eagerly.  'You shall have it immediately, if you will.' 

'Why, thank you, miss!' said Blathers, drawing his ****-****** across his mouth; 'it's *** work, this sort of ****.  ******** that's *****, miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our ********.' 

'What shall it be?' asked the doctor, following the young lady to the 



'A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,' replied Blathers.  'It's a cold **** from London, ma'am; and I always find that spirits comes home ****** to the feelings.' 

This *********** ************* was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very **********.  While it was being ******** to her, the doctor ******* out of the room. 

'Ah!' said Mr. Blathers:  not ******* his ****-***** by the ****, but ******** the ****** between the ***** and ********** of his left hand: and ******* it in front of his *****; 'I have seen a good many ****** of business like this, in my time, ladies.' 

'That ***** down in the back **** at ********, Blathers,' said Mr. Duff, ********* his *********'* ******. 

'That was something in this way, ****'* it?' rejoined Mr. Blathers; 'that was done by ****** Chickweed, that was.' 

'You always gave that to him' replied Duff.  'It was the Family ***, I tell you.  ****** ****'* any more to do with it than I had.' 

'Get out!' retorted Mr. Blathers; 'I know better.  Do you mind that time when ****** was ****** of his money, though?  What a ***** that was!  Better than any *****-**** _I_ ever see!' 

'What was that?' inquired Rose:  anxious to ********* any ******** of ****-****** in the ********* ********. 

'It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,' said Blathers.  'This here ****** Chickweed--' 

'****** means *****, ma'am,' interposed Duff. 

'Of course the lady knows that, don't she?' demanded Mr. Blathers. 'Always ************, you are, *******!  This here ****** Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over ************ way, and he had a ******, where a good many young ***** went to see ****-********, and ******-*******, and that; and a **** ************ manner the ****** was ********* in, for I've seen 'em ***'**.  He ****'* one of the family, at that time; and one night he was ****** of three ******* and ******-***** ******* in a ****** ***, that was ***** out of his ******* in the dead of night, by a **** man with a black ***** over his eye, who had ********* himself under the bed, and after ********** the robbery, ****** **** out of window:  which was only a story high. He was **** quick about it.  But ****** was quick, too; for he ***** a *********** ***** him, and roused the *************. They set up a ***-***-***, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that ****** had *** the robber; for there was ****** of blood, all the way to some ******* a good distance off; and there they lost 'em.  However, he had made off with the *****; and, ************, the name of Mr. Chickweed, ******** ******, appeared in the ******* among the other *********; and all manner of ******** and *************, and I don't know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a **** low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a ******* his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a *****, and had a ******* ********* with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, ***** the bell, and ****** *** ****** in (*** was a ****** officer), and ***** him to go and ****** Mr. Chickweed in ************ the man as ****** his house. "I see him, ******," said Chickweed, "**** my house ********* morning," "Why didn't you up, and ****** him!" says ******.  "I was so struck all of a ****, that you might have ********* my ***** with a *********," says the poor man; "but we're sure to have him; for between ten and ****** o'clock at night he passed again."  ****** no sooner heard this, than he put some ***** ***** and a ****, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he ****, and **** himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red *******, with his hat on, all ready to **** out, at a moment's notice. He was ******* his **** here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed ***** out, "Here he is! Stop thief!  Murder!"  *** ****** ****** out; and there he **** Chickweed, *-******* down the street full cry.  Away **** ******; on **** Chickweed; round turns the people; ********* ***** out, "*******!" and Chickweed himself ***** on ********, all the time, like mad.  ****** ***** sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; ****** round; **** a little crowd; ***** in; "Which is the man?" "*--**!" says Chickweed, "I've lost him again!"  It was a ********** **********, but he ****'* to be seen *******, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, ****** took his old place, and looked out, from behind the *******, for a **** man with a black ***** over his eye, till his own two eyes ***** again.  At last, he couldn't help ******** 'em, to **** 'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he ***** Chickweed *-******* out, "Here he is!"  Off he ****** once more, with Chickweed ****-*** down the street ***** of him; and after twice as long a run as the *********'* one, the man's lost again!  This was done, once or twice more, till ***-**** the ********** gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been ****** by the devil, who was ******* ****** with him **********; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with *****.' 

'What did *** ****** say?' inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room ******* after the ************ of the story. 

'*** ******,' resumed the officer, 'for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without ******* to, which showed he ********** his business.  But, one morning, he walked into the ***, and taking out his ********, says "Chickweed, I've found out who done this here robbery."  "Have you?" said Chickweed.  "Oh, my dear ******, only let me have *********, and I shall die *********!  Oh, my dear ******, where is the *******!"  "Come!" said ******, ******** him a ***** of *****, "none of that ******!  You did it yourself."  So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he ****'* been so ******** anxious to keep up ***********!' said Mr. Blathers, putting down his ****-*****, and ******** the ********* together. 

'Very *******, indeed,' observed the doctor.  'Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.' 

'If _you_ please, sir,' returned Mr. Blathers.  ******* following Mr. Losberne, the two ******** ******** to Oliver's *******; Mr. Giles ********* the party, with a ******* candle. 

Oliver had been ******; but looked worse, and was more ******** than he had appeared yet.  Being ******** by the doctor, he ******* to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the ********* without at all ************* what was going *******--** fact, without ******* to ********* where he was, or what had been passing. 

'This,' said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great ********* ***************, 'this is the lad, who, being ********** ******* by a ******-*** in some ****** ******** on Mr. ****-*' **-****-***'* *******, at the back here, comes to the house for ********** this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and **********, by that ********* gentleman with the candle in his hand:  who has placed his life in ************ danger, as I can ************** *******.' 

******. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus *********** to their notice.  The ********** ****** ***** from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ********* ******* of fear and **********. 

'You don't mean to **** that, I suppose?' said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again. 

'It was all done for ***--*** the best, sir,' answered Giles. 'I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn't have ******* with him.  I am not of an ******* ***********, sir.' 

'Thought it was what boy?' inquired the ****** officer. 

'The ************'* boy, sir!' replied Giles.  '****--**** certainly had a boy.' 

'Well?  Do you think so now?' inquired Blathers. 

'Think what, now?' replied Giles, looking ******** at his **********. 

'Think it's the same boy, ******-****?' rejoined Blathers, impatiently. 

'I don't know; I really don't know,' said Giles, with a ****** countenance.  'I couldn't ***** to him.' 

'What do you think?' asked Mr. Blathers. 

'I don't know what to think,' replied poor Giles.  'I don't think it is the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't.  You know it can't 



'Has this man been *-********, sir?' inquired Blathers, turning to the 



'What a ******** ******-****** **** you are!' said Duff, ********** Mr. Giles, with ******* ********. 

Mr. Losberne had been feeling the *******'* ***** during this short ********; but he now rose from the chair by the *******, and ********, that if the ******** had any ****** upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them. 

****** upon this **********, they ********* to a ************ *********, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, ******** himself and his ********* ******** in such a ********* **** of fresh ************** and ***************, as ****** to ***** no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong *************; except, indeed, his ************ that he *******'* know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes **********, ******** in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too *****. 

Among other ********* ********, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really *** anybody; and upon *********** of the fellow ****** to that which he had *****, it turned out to have no more *********** ******* than ********* and ***** paper: a ********* which made a ************ ********** on ********* but the doctor, who had drawn the **** about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a ******* ********** than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after *********, for some hours, under the fear of having ******** ******* a ******-********, eagerly caught at this new ****, and ******** it to the ******.  *******, the ********, without ********* themselves very much about Oliver, left the ******** ********* in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; ********* to return the next 



With the next morning, there came a ******, that two men and a boy were in the **** at ********, who had been *********** over night under ********** circumstances; and to ******** ******. Blathers and Duff ********* ***********. The ********** circumstances, however, ********* themselves, on *************, into the one fact, that they had been ********** ******** under a ********; which, although a great *****, is only ********** by ************, and is, in the ******** eye of the ******* ***, and its ************* love of all the ****'* ********, held to be no ************ proof, in the ******* of all other ********, that the *******, or ********, have ********* ******** accompanied with violence, and have ********* rendered themselves ****** to the ********** of death; ******. Blathers and Duff came back again, as **** as they went. 

In short, after some more ***********, and a great deal more conversation, a ************ magistrate was ******* ******* to take the ***** **** of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being ******** with a couple of *******, returned to town with ******* ******** on the subject of their **********: the latter gentleman on a ****** consideration of all the circumstances, ********* to the ****** that the *********** ******* had ********** with the Family ***; and the former being ******* disposed to ******* the full ***** of it to the great Mr. ****** Chickweed. 

Meanwhile, Oliver gradually ****** and ********* under the ****** care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the ****-******* Mr. Losberne.  If ******* *******, ******* from ****** *********** with *********, be heard in ******--*** if they be not, what ******* ***!--*** ********* which the ****** child called down upon them, **** into their *****, ********* ***** and happiness. 





CHAPTER ***** 

OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO **** WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS 

Oliver's ******* were neither slight nor few.  In ******** to the pain and ***** ********* on a broken ****, his ******** to the *** and cold had brought on fever and ****:  which hung about him for many *****, and ******* him *****. But, at length, he began, by **** *******, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few ******* words, how ****** he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ******** he ***** that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his *********; only something, which would let them see the love and **** with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would ***** to them that their gentle ******** had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their ******* had ******* from misery, or death, was ***** to ***** them with his whole heart and soul. 

'Poor fellow!' said Rose, when Oliver had been one day ****** ************ to ***** the words of ************ that rose to his pale lips; 'you shall have many ************* of ******* us, if you will. We are going into the country, and my **** ******* that you shall ********* us.  The quiet place, the **** air, and all the pleasure and ******** of ******, will ******* you in a few days.  We will ****** you in a ******* ****, when you can bear the trouble.' 

'The trouble!' cried Oliver.  'Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by ******** your *******, or watching your *****, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!' 

'You shall give nothing at all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; 'for, as I told you before, we shall ****** you in a ******* ****; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.' 

'Happy, ma'am!' cried Oliver; 'how kind of you to say so!' 

'You will make me ******* than I can tell you,' replied the young lady. 'To think that my dear good **** should have been the means of ******** any one from such *** misery as you have ********* to us, would be an *********** pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and ********** was ********* ******** and ********, in ***********, would ******* me, more than you can well *******.  Do you understand me?' she inquired, watching Oliver's ********** face. 

'Oh yes, ma'am, yes!' replied Oliver eagerly; 'but I was thinking that I am ********** now.' 

'To whom?' inquired the young lady. 

'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old *****, who took so much care of me before,' rejoined Oliver.  'If they knew how happy I am, they would be *******, I am sure.' 

'I am sure they would,' rejoined Oliver's ************; 'and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the *******, he will carry you to see them.' 

'Has he, ma'am?' cried Oliver, his face *********** with pleasure.  'I don't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once 



In a short time Oliver was ************ ********* to ******* the ******* of this **********.  One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, ***********, in a little ******** which ******** to Mrs. Maylie.  When they came to ******** Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud ***********. 

'What's the matter with the boy?' cried the doctor, as usual, all in a ******.  'Do you see ********--**** ********--**** ********--**?' 

'That, sir,' cried Oliver, pointing out of the ******** window. 'That 



'Yes; well, what of it?  Stop ********.  **** up here,' cried the doctor.  'What of the house, my man; eh?' 

'The *******--*** house they took me to!' whispered Oliver. 

'The devil it is!' cried the doctor.  '*****, there! let me out!' 

But, before the ******** could ******** from his box, he had ******* out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the ******** ********, began ******* at the door like a ******. 

'******?' said a little **** ****-****** man:  opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very ******* of his last ****, nearly fell forward into the passage. 'What's the matter here?' 

'Matter!' exclaimed the other, ********* him, without a moment's **********.  'A good deal.  Robbery is the matter.' 

'*****'** be Murder the matter, too,' replied the ****-****** man, ******, 'if you don't take your hands off.  Do you hear me?' 

'I hear you,' said the doctor, giving his ******* a ****** *****. 

'*****'*--******** the fellow, what's his ******** ****--*****; that's it.  *****'* Sikes, you thief?' 

The ****-****** man ******, as if in ****** of ********* and ***********; then, ******** himself, ***********, from the ******'* *****, growled forth a ****** of ****** *****, and ******* into the house.  Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of ******. 

He looked ********* round; not an ******* of *********; not a ******* of anything, ******* or *********; not even the position of the *********; answered Oliver's ***********! 

'Now!' said the ****-****** man, who had watched him ******, 'what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to *** me, or to murder me?  Which is it?' 

'Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a ******* and pair, you ********** old *******?' said the ********* doctor. 

'What do you want, then?' demanded the *********.  'Will you take yourself off, before I do you a ********?  ***** you!' 

'As soon as I think ******,' said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, **** no *********** ******** to Oliver's account of it.  'I shall find you out, some day, my friend.' 

'Will you?' ******* the ***-******** *******.  'If you ever want me, I'm here.  I haven't ***** here mad and all alone, for ****-***-****** years, to be ****** by you.  You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.'  And so saying, the ***-****** little ***** set up a ****, and ****** upon the ground, as if **** with ****. 

'****** enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself; 'the boy must have made a *******.  Here!  Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.'  With these words he ***** the ********* a piece of money, and returned to the ********. 

The man followed to the ******* door, ******** the ******* ************ and ****** all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the ******, he looked into the ********, and **** Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and ****** and at the same time so ******* and **********, that, ****** or ********, he could not ****** it for months afterwards.  He continued to ***** the most ******* ************, until the ****** had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: ******* his feet upon the ground, and ******* his hair, in ********** of real or ********* ****. 

'I am an ***!' said the doctor, after a long silence.  'Did you know that before, Oliver?' 

'No, sir.' 

'Then don't ****** it another time.' 

'An ***,' said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.  'Even if it had been the right place, and the right ******* had been there, what could I have done, ******-******? And if I had had **********, I see no good that I should have done, except ******* to my own ********, and an *********** ********* of the manner in which I have ****** up this business. That would have ****** me right, though. I am always ********* myself in some ****** or other, by ****** on *******.  It might have done me good.' 

Now, the fact was that the ********* doctor had never ***** upon anything but ******* all through his life, and it was no bad ********** to the nature of the ******** which ******** him, that so far from being ******** in any ******** ******** or ***********, he had the ******* ******* and ****** of all who knew him.  If the truth must be told, he was a little out of ******, for a minute or two, at being ************ in ********* ************* ******** of Oliver's story on the very first occasion on which he had a ****** of ********* any.  He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's ******* to his *********, were still as *************** and **********, and still ********* with as much ******** ********* and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to ****** full ******** to them, from that time forth. 

As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow *******, they were ******* to ***** straight *******.  When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so *********, that he could scarcely **** his 



'Now, my boy, which house is it?' inquired Mr. Losberne. 

'That!  That!' replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. 'The white house.  Oh! make *****!  Pray make *****! I feel as if I should die: it ***** me ******* so.' 

'Come, come!' said the good doctor, ******* him on the shoulder. 'You will see them directly, and they will be ********* to find you safe and 



'Oh!  I hope so!' cried Oliver.  'They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.' 

The coach ****** on.  It stopped.  No; that was the wrong house; the next door.  It went on a few *****, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy *********** ******** down his face. 

****! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. 'To Let.' 

'***** at the next door,' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in his.  'What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the ********* house, do you know?' 

The ******* did not know; but would go and *******.  She ********* returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had **** off his *****, and gone to the **** ******, six ***** before.  Oliver ******* his hands, and **** ****** ********. 

'Has his *********** gone too?' inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment's 



'Yes, sir'; replied the *******.  'The old gentleman, the ***********, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. ********'*, all went together.' 

'Then turn towards home again,' said Mr. Losberne to the ******; 'and don't stop to **** the ******, till you get out of this ********** 



'The ****-***** ******, sir?' said Oliver.  'I know the way there.  See him, pray, sir!  Do see him!' 

'My poor boy, this is ************** enough for one day,' said the doctor.  'Quite enough for both of us.  If we go to the ****-***** ******'*, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away.  No; home again straight!'  And in ********* to the ******'* *******, home they went. 

This ****** ************** ****** Oliver much ****** and *****, even in the ***** of his happiness; for he had ******* himself, many times during his *******, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what ******* it would be to tell them how many long days and ****** he had passed in ********** on what they had done for him, and in ********* his ***** ********** from them. The hope of ********** ******** himself with them, too, and ********** how he had been forced away, had ****** him up, and ********* him, under many of his ****** ******; and now, the **** that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the ****** that he was an ******** and a ******--* ****** which might ****** ************** to his ***** ***--*** almost more than he could bear. 

The ************ ********** no **********, however, in the ********* of his ***********.  After another *********, when the fine **** ******* had ****** *****, and every **** and ****** was putting forth its young ****** and **** ********, they made ************ for ******** the house at ********, for some months. 

******* the *****, which had so ******* *****'* ********, to the ******'*; and leaving Giles and another ******* in care of the house, they ******** to a ******* at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them. 

Who can ******** the pleasure and *******, the ***** of mind and **** ************, the ****** boy felt in the ***** air, and among the green ***** and **** *****, of an ****** *******!  Who can tell how ****** of ***** and ******** **** into the ***** of ****-**** ******** in close and ***** ******, and carry their own *********, deep into their ***** ******!  Men who have ***** in crowded, ****-** streets, through ***** of ****, and who have never ****** for change; men, to whom ****** has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each ***** and stone that ****** the narrow ********** of their ***** *****; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to ***** at last for one short ******* of ******'* face; and, carried far from the ****** of their old ***** and *********, have seemed to **** at once into a new state of being.  ******** forth, from day to day, to some green ***** spot, they have had such ******** ******* up within them by the sight of the ***, and hill and *****, and ********** water, that a ********* of heaven itself has ******* their quick *******, and they have **** into their *****, as ********** as the *** whose ******* they watched from their ****** ******* window but a few hours before, ***** from their *** and ****** sight!  The ******** which ******** country ****** call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and *****. Their gentle ********* may ***** us how to ***** fresh ******** for the ****** of those we *****:  may ****** our thoughts, and bear down before it old ****** and ******; but beneath all this, there *******, in the least ********** mind, a ***** and ****-****** ************* of having held such feelings long before, in some ****** and ******* time, which ***** up ****** thoughts of ******* times to come, and ***** down ***** and *********** beneath it. 

It was a ****** spot to which they ********.  Oliver, whose days had been ***** among ******* ******, and in the ***** of noise and ********, seemed to ***** on a new ********* there.  The rose and *********** ***** to the ******* walls; the *** crept round the ****** of the *****; and the ******-******* ******** the air with ********* ******.  Hard by, was a little **********; not crowded with **** ********* ***********, but full of ****** ******, covered with fresh **** and ****: beneath which, the old people of the ******* lay at rest.  Oliver often ******** here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and *** ******; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep *** ********, he would ***** to think of her as lying in the ground, and would **** for her, *****, but without pain. 

It was a happy time.  The days were ******** and ******; the ****** brought with them neither fear nor care; no *********** in a wretched ******, or *********** with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.  Every morning he went to a *****-****** old gentleman, who ***** near the little church: who ****** him to read better, and to *****:  and who spoke so ******, and took such *****, that Oliver could never *** enough to please him.  Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some ***** place, and listen ****** the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the *******. Then, he had his own ****** for the next day to *******; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the ******, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: ********* with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they wanted a ****** that he could ***** to *****, or had ********* anything he could run to *****: that he could never be quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the *****, and **** some pleasant air, or ****, in a low and gentle voice, some old **** which it ******* her **** to hear. There would be no ******* ******* at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, ********* to the sweet *****, in a ******* *******. 

And when ****** came, how *********** the day was *****, from any way in which he had ever ***** it yet! and how ******* too; like all the other days in that most happy time!  There was the little church, in the morning, with the green ****** ********** at the windows:  the ***** ******* without:  and the *****-******** air ******** in at the low *****, and ******* the ****** ******** with its *********. The poor people were so **** and *****, and ***** so ********** in ******, that it seemed a pleasure, not a ******* ****, their ********** there together; and though the ******* might be ****, it was real, and ******* more ******* (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before.  Then, there were the ***** as usual, and many ***** at the ***** houses of the ********* men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the *****, which he had been ******** all the week, and in the *********** of which **** he felt more ***** and *******, than if he had been the ********* himself. 

In the morning, Oliver would be *-**** by six o'clock, ******* the fields, and ********** the ******, far and ****, for ******** of **** *******, with which he would return *****, home; and which it took great care and consideration to *******, to the best *********, for the ************* of the *********-*****. There was fresh *********, too, for Miss ******'* *****, with which Oliver, who had been ******** the subject under the able ******* of the ******* *****, would ******** the *****, in the most ******** *****. When the ***** were made all ****** and ***** for the day, there was ******* some little ********** of ******* to ******* in the *******; or, ******* that, there was **** *******-*******, sometimes, on the green; or, ******* that, there was always something to do in the ******, or about the ******, to which Oliver (who had ******* this ******* also, under the same master, who was a ******** by trade,) ******* himself with ****** ****-****, until Miss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a ******** ************* to be ******** on all he had done. 

So three months ****** away; three months which, in the life of the most ******* and ******** of *******, might have been ********* happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true ********. With the ****** and most ******* ********** on one side; and the ******, *******, ****-**** ********* on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become ********** ************ with the old lady and her *****, and that the ******* ********** of his young and ********* heart, was ****** by their ***** in, and ********** to, himself. 





CHAPTER ****** 

******* THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, *********** A SUDDEN 



****** **** ******* by, and ****** came.  If the ******* had been beautiful at first it was now in the full **** and ********** of its ********.  The great *****, which had looked ******** and **** in the ******* months, had now burst into strong life and ******; and ********** forth their green arms over the ******* ground, ********* open and ***** ***** into ****** *****, where was a deep and pleasant ***** from which to look upon the **** ********, ******* in ********, which lay ********* beyond.  The earth had ****** her ****** of ********* green; and **** her ******* ******** ******.  It was the ***** and ****** of the year; all things were glad and ***********. 

Still, the same quiet life went on at the little *******, and the same ******** ******** ********* among its *******.  Oliver had long since ***** ***** and *******; but ****** or ******** made no ********** in his **** feelings of a great many people.  He was still the same gentle, ********, ************ creature that he had been when pain and ********* had ****** his strength, and when he was ********* for every slight attention, and ******* on those who ****** him. 

One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was ********* with them:  for the day had been ********* ****, and there was a ********* ****, and a light wind had ****** up, which was ********* **********.  Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far ******** their ******** ******.  Mrs. Maylie being ********, they returned more slowly home.  The young lady merely ******** off her ****** ******, sat down to the ***** as usual.  After running ************ over the **** for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very ****** air; and as she ****** it, they heard a sound as if she were *******. 

'Rose, my dear!' said the ***** lady. 

Rose made no reply, but ****** a little *******, as though the words had roused her from some ******* thoughts. 

'Rose, my love!' cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and ******* over her.  'What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what ********** you?' 

'Nothing, ****; nothing,' replied the young lady.  'I don't know what it is; I can't ******** it; but I feel--' 

'Not ill, my love?' interposed Mrs. Maylie. 

'No, no!  Oh, not ill!' replied Rose: ********** as though some ****** ********* were passing over her, while she spoke; 'I shall be better *********.  Close the window, pray!' 

Oliver ******** to ****** with her *******.  The young lady, making an effort to ******* her ************, ****** to **** some ******** ****; but her ******* dropped ********* over the ****. ******** her face with her hands, she **** upon a ****, and gave **** to the tears which she was now ****** to *******. 

'My child!' said the ******* lady, ******* her arms about her, 'I never saw you so before.' 

'I would not alarm you if I could ***** it,' rejoined Rose; 'but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, ****.' 

She was, indeed; for, when ******* were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had ******* since their return home, the *** of her countenance had changed to a ****** *********. Its expression had lost nothing of its ******; but it was changed; and there was an anxious ******* look about the gentle face, which it had never **** before.  Another minute, and it was ******** with a ******* *****:  and a heavy ******** came over the **** **** eye.  Again this ***********, like the ****** ****** by a passing *****; and she was once more ****** 



Oliver, who watched the old lady *********, observed that she was ******* by these ***********; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she ******** to make light of them, he *********** to do the same, and they so far *********, that when Rose was ********* by her **** to ****** for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better ******:  ******** them that she felt certain she should **** in the morning, quite well. 

'I hope,' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, 'that nothing is the matter?  She don't look well to-night, but--' 

The old lady ******** to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a trembling voice: 

'I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should **** with some **********; but I hope it is not this.' 

'What?' inquired Oliver. 

'The heavy blow,' said the old lady, 'of ****** the dear girl who has so long been my ******* and happiness.' 

'Oh!  God ******!' exclaimed Oliver, hastily. 

'**** to that, my child!' said the old lady, ******** her hands. 

'****** there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' said Oliver. 'Two hours ago, she was quite well.' 

'She is very ill now,' rejoined Mrs. *******; 'and will be worse, I am sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her!' 

She gave way to such great *****, that Oliver, *********** his own *******, ******** to *********** with her; and to beg, *********, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more ****. 

'And ********, ma'am,' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, ******* of his ******* to the ********. 'Oh! ******** how young and good she is, and what pleasure and ******* she ***** to all about her.  I am ****--*******--***** *******--****, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she ***** so happy; she will not die.  Heaven will never let her die so 



'Hush!' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver's head. 'You think like a child, poor boy.  But you ***** me my ****, ***************.  I had ********* it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be ********, for I am old, and have seen enough of ******* and death to know the ***** of ********** from the ******* of our love.  I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the ******** and best who are ****** to those that love them; but this should give us ******* in our ******; for Heaven is just; and such things ***** us, ************, that there is a ******** world than this; and that the passage to it is ******. ***'* will be done!  I love her; and He knows how well!' 

Oliver was ********* to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she ******* her ************ as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became ******** and ****.  He was still more ********** to find that this ******** ******; and that, under all the care and watching which ******, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and *********: ********** all the ****** which had ******** upon her, ********, and, to all ******** ***********, even **********.  But he was young, and did not know what strong ***** are ******* of, under ****** circumstances.  How should he, when their ********** so ****** know themselves? 

An anxious night ******.  When morning came, Mrs. ******'* *********** were but too well ********.  Rose was in the first ***** of a high and ********* fever. 

'We must be ******, Oliver, and not give way to ******* *****,' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her ****** on her ***, as she looked ******** into his face; 'this ****** must be sent, with all possible **********, to Mr. Losberne.  It must be carried to the ******-****: which is not more than four miles off, by the ******** across the *****:  and ****** **********, by an ******* on *********, straight to ********. The people at the *** will ********* to do this: and I can ***** to you to see it done, I know.' 

Oliver could make no reply, but looked his ******* to be gone at once. 

'Here is another ******,' said Mrs. Maylie, ******* to *******; 'but whether to send it now, or **** until I see how Rose **** on, I scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I ****** the *****.' 

'Is it for ********, too, ma'am?' inquired Oliver; ********* to ******* his **********, and ******* out his trembling hand for the ******. 

'No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him ************. Oliver ******* at it, and saw that it was ******** to Harry Maylie, *******, at some great ****'* house in the country; where, he could not make out. 

'Shall it go, ma'am?' asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently. 

'I think not,' replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  'I will **** until 



With these words, she gave Oliver her *****, and he started off, without more *****, at the ******** ***** he could ******. 

******* he ran across the fields, and down the little ***** which sometimes ******* them: now almost ****** by the high **** on either side, and now ******** on an open *****, where the ****** and ********* were **** at their work:  nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few *******, to ******* breath, until he came, in a great ****, and covered with ****, on the little ******-***** of the ******-****. 

Here he paused, and looked about for the ***.  There were a white ****, and a red *******, and a ****** ****-****; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the **** about it ******* green:  before which was the **** of 'The ******.'  To this he ********, as soon as it caught his eye. 

He spoke to a ******* who was ****** under the *******; and who, after ******* what he wanted, ******** him to the ******; who after ******* all he had to say again, ******** him to the ********; who was a **** gentleman in a **** *********, a white hat, **** ********, and ***** with **** to *****, ******* against a **** by the ******-****, ******* his teeth with a ****** *********. 

This gentleman walked with much ************ into the *** to make out the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it was ready, and ****, a ***** had to be *******, and a man to be *******, which took up ten good minutes more.  Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of ********** and *******, that he felt as if he could have ****** upon the ***** himself, and ******** away, full ****, to the next *****.  At length, all was ready; and the little ****** having been ****** up, with many *********** and ********** for its ****** ********, the man set ***** to his *****, and ******** over the ****** ****** of the ******-*****, was out of the town, and ********* along the ********-****, in a couple of minutes. 

As it was something to feel certain that ********** was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the ***-****, with a ******** ******* heart.  He was turning out of the ******* when he ********** ******** against a **** man ******* in a *****, who was at that moment coming out of the *** door. 

'***!' cried the man, ****** his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly *********.  'What the *****'* this?' 

'I beg your ******, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great ***** to get home, and didn't see you were coming.' 

'Death!' muttered the man to himself, ******* at the boy with his large dark eyes.  'Who would have thought it! ***** him to *****! He'd ***** up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!' 

'I am *****,' ********* Oliver, ******** by the strange man's **** look.  'I hope I have not **** you!' 

'*** you!' ******** the man, in a ******** passion; between his ******** teeth; 'if I had only had the ******* to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night.  ****** on your head, and black death on your heart, you ***!  What are you doing here?' 

The man shook his ****, as he uttered these words ************. He ******** towards Oliver, as if with the ********* of ****** a blow at him, but fell ********* on the ground:  ******** and *******, in a fit. 

Oliver *****, for a moment, at the ********* of the ****** (for such he supposed him to be); and then ****** into the house for help.  Having seen him ****** carried into the *****, he turned his face *********, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:  and ********* with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the ************* ********* of the person from whom he had just ******. 

The ************ did not ***** in his ************ long, however: for when he reached the *******, there was enough to ****** his mind, and to ***** all ************** of **** ********** from his ******. 

Rose Maylie had ******* ***** worse; before ***-***** she was *********.  A ******* ************, who ******* on the spot, was in ******** ********** upon her; and after first seeing the *******, he had taken Mrs. Maylie *****, and ********** her ******** to be one of a most ******** nature. 'In fact,' he said, 'it would be little short of a *******, if she *********.' 

How often did Oliver ***** from his bed that night, and ******** out, with ********* ********, to the *********, listen for the ********* sound from the sick *******!  How often did a ******* ***** his *****, and cold ***** of ****** ***** upon his ****, when a sudden ********* of feet ****** him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then ********!  And what had been the ******** of all the ******* he had ever muttered, ******** with those he ****** forth, now, in the ***** and passion of his ************ for the life and ****** of the gentle creature, who was ********* on the deep *****'* *****! 

Oh! the ********, the *******, ***** ********, of standing **** by while the life of one we ****** love, is trembling in the *******!  Oh! the ******* thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat *********, and the breath come thick, by the force of the ****** they ******* up before it; the desperate ******* _to be doing something_ to ******* the pain, or ****** the danger, which we have no power to *********; the ******* of soul and ******, which the *** *********** of our ************ ********; what ******** can ***** these; what *********** or ********** can, in the full **** and fever of the time, ***** them! 

Morning came; and the little ******* was ****** and still. People spoke in ********; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. All the ******** day, and for hours after it had ***** dark, Oliver ***** softly up and down the ******, raising his eyes every instant to the sick *******, and ********** to see the ******** window, looking as if death lay ********* inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  'It is hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so much *******; but there is very little hope.' 

Another morning.  The *** ***** ********; as ******** as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every **** and ****** in full ***** about her; with life, and ******, and ****** and ****** of joy, *********** her on every side: the **** young creature lay, ******* fast.  Oliver crept away to the old **********, and sitting down on one of the green ******, **** and ****** for her, in silence. 

There was such ***** and ****** in the scene; so much of ********** and ***** in the ***** *********; such ********** ***** in the ***** of the ****** *****; such ******* in the ***** ****** of the ****, ********* ********; so much of life and ********** in all; that, when the boy raised his ****** eyes, and looked about, the thought ************* ******** to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could ****** never die when ******* things were all so glad and ***; that ****** were for cold and ********* ******:  not for ******** and *********. He almost thought that ******* were for the old and ********; and that they never ******* the young and ******** form in their ******* *****. 

A ***** from the church bell ***** ******* on these ******** thoughts. Another!  Again!  It was ******* for the ******* *******.  A ***** of ****** ******** entered the gate: ******* white *******; for the ****** was young.  They stood ********* by a grave; and there was a ******--* mother ****--***** the ******* *****.  But the *** ***** ********, and the ***** **** on. 

Oliver turned ********, thinking on the many ********** he had received from the young lady, and ******* that the time could come again, that he might never ***** ******* her how ******** and ******** he was.  He had no cause for ****-******** on the ***** of *******, or want of thought, for he had been ******* to her *******; and yet a ******* little ********* rose up before him, on which he ******* he might have been more *******, and more earnest, and ****** he had been.  We need be ******* how we deal with those about us, when every death ******* to some small ****** of *********, thoughts of so much *******, and so little ****--** so many things *********, and so many more which might have been ********!  There is no ******* so deep as that which is **********; if we would be ****** its ********, let us ******** this, in time. 

When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. Oliver's heart **** at sight of her; for she had never left the ******* of her *****; and he ******** to think what change could have ****** her away.  He ****** that she had ****** into a deep sleep, from which she would *****, either to ******** and life, or to *** them ********, and die. 

They sat, *********, and afraid to speak, for hours.  The ******** **** was *******, with looks which showed that their thoughts were *********, they watched the *** as he **** lower and lower, and, at length, cast over *** and earth those ********* **** which ****** his *********.  Their quick ears caught the sound of an *********** ********.  They both ************* ****** to the door, as Mr. Losberne 



'What of Rose?' cried the old lady.  'Tell me at once!  I can bear it; anything but ********!  Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!' 

'You must ******* yourself,' said the doctor ********** her. 'Be ****, my dear ma'am, pray.' 

'Let me go, in ***'* name!  My dear child!  She is dead! She is *****!' 

'No!' cried the doctor, ************.  'As He is good and ********, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.' 

The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to **** her hands together; but the ****** which had ********* her so long, **** up to Heaven with her first ************; and she **** into the ******** arms which were ******** to ******* her. 





CHAPTER ***** 

******** SOME ************ *********** ******** TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ******* UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ********* WHICH HAPPENED TO 



It was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt ******* and ********* by the ********** intelligence; he could not ****, or speak, or rest.  He had scarcely the power of ************* anything that had passed, until, after a long ****** in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his ******, and he seemed to ******, all at once, to a full sense of the ****** change that had ********, and the almost ************* **** of ******* which had been taken from his breast. 

The night was fast ******* in, when he returned ********:  ***** with ******* which he had ******, with ******** care, for the ********* of the sick *******.  As he walked ******* along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some *******, *********** at a ******* pace.  Looking round, he saw that it was a ****-******, ****** at great *****; and as the ****** were *********, and the road was narrow, he stood ******* against a gate until it should have passed him. 

As it ****** on, Oliver caught a ******* of a man in a white ********, whose face seemed ******** to him, although his view was so brief that he could not ******** the person.  In another second or two, the ******** was thrust out of the ******-******, and a ********** voice ******** to the ****** to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could **** up his ******.  Then, the ******** once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name. 

'Here!' cried the voice.  'Oliver, what's the ****?  Miss Rose! Master 



'Is is you, Giles?' cried Oliver, running up to the ******-****. 

Giles ****** out his ******** again, *********** to making some reply, when he was suddenly ****** back by a young gentleman who ******** the other corner of the ******, and who eagerly demanded what was the ****. 

'In a word!' cried the gentleman, 'Better or worse?' 

'******--**** better!' replied Oliver, hastily. 

'Thank Heaven!' exclaimed the gentleman.  'You are sure?' 

'Quite, sir,' replied Oliver.  'The change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.' 

The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the ******-****, ****** out, and taking Oliver ********* by the arm, led him *****. 

'You are quite certain?  There is no *********** of any ******* on your part, my boy, is there?' demanded the gentleman in a ********* voice. 'Do not ******* me, by ********* ***** that are not to be *********.' 

'I would not for the world, sir,' replied Oliver.  'Indeed you may believe me.  Mr. ********'* words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.' 

The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he ******** the scene which was the ********* of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver thought he heard him ***, more than once; but he ****** to ********* him by any fresh ******--*** he could well ***** what his feelings ****--*** so stood *****, ******** to be ******** with his *******. 

All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white ******** on, had been sitting on the steps of the ******, ********** an ***** on each ****, and ****** his eyes with a **** ****** ******-************ ****** with white *****.  That the ****** fellow had not been ******** *******, was ********** ************ by the very red eyes with which he ******** the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him. 

'I think you had better go on to my ******'* in the ******, Giles,' said he.  'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to **** a little time before I see her.  You can say I am coming.' 

'I beg your ******, Mr. Harry,' said Giles:  giving a ***** ****** to his ******* countenance with the handkerchief; 'but if you would leave the ******* to say that, I should be very much ******* to you.  It wouldn't be ****** for the ***** to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more ********* with them if they did.' 

'Well,' rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, 'you can do as you like. Let him go on with the *******, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first ******** that ******** for some more *********** ********, or we shall be taken for ******.' 

Mr. Giles, ******** of his ********** *******, ******** off and ******** his ********; and *********** a hat, of grave and ***** *****, which he took out of the ******.  This done, the ******* ***** off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their *******. 

As they walked along, Oliver ******* from time to time with much interest and ********* at the new *****.  He seemed about ****-***-****** years of age, and was of the ****** ******; his countenance was ***** and ********; and his ******** **** and *************.  *************** the ********** between ***** and age, he **** so strong a ******** to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great ********** in ********* their ************, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother. 

Mrs. Maylie was ********* ******* to ******* her *** when he reached the *******.  The ******* did not take place without great ******* on both *****. 

'Mother!' whispered the young man; 'why did you not ***** before?' 

'I did,' replied Mrs. Maylie; 'but, on **********, I determined to keep back the ****** until I had heard Mr. ********'* opinion.' 

'But why,' said the young man, 'why run the ****** of that ********* which so nearly happened?  If Rose ***--* cannot ***** that word ***--** this ******* had ********** ***********, how could you ever have ******** yourself!  How could I ever have know happiness again!' 

'If that _had_ been the case, Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'I fear your happiness would have been *********** ********, and that your ******* here, a day sooner or a day *****, would have been of very, very little 



'And who can wonder if it be so, mother?' rejoined the young man; 'or why should I say, _**_?--** **--** **--*** know it, ******--*** must know it!' 

'I know that she ******** the best and ****** love the heart of man can *****,' said Mrs. Maylie; 'I know that the ******** and ********* of her nature ******* no ******** return, but one that shall be deep and *******.  If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed ********* in one she ***** would ***** her heart, I should not feel my **** so ********* of ***********, or have to ********* so many ********* in my own *****, when I take what ***** to me to be the ****** **** of ****.' 

'This is ******, mother,' said Harry.  'Do you still suppose that I am a boy ******** of my own mind, and ********* the ******** of my own 



'I think, my dear ***,' returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, 'that ***** has many ******** ******** which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being *********, become only the more ********.  Above all, I think' said the lady, ****** her eyes on her ***'* face, 'that if an ************, ******, and ********* man ***** a wife on whose name there is a *****, which, though it ********* in no ***** of ****, may be ******* by cold and ****** people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in ***** ********** to his ******* in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of ****** against him:  he may, no matter how ******** and good his nature, one day ****** of the ********** he ****** in early life.  And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.' 

'Mother,' said the young man, impatiently, 'he would be a ******* *****, ******** ***** of the name of man and of the woman you ********, who ***** thus.' 

'You think so now, Harry,' replied his mother. 

'And ever will!' said the young man.  'The ****** ***** I have ********, during the last two days, ****** from me the ****** to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of *********, nor one I have ******* ******.  On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.  I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you ****** me in this great *****, you take my ***** and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.  Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not ********* the happiness of which you **** to think so little.' 

'Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'it is because I think so much of **** and ********* ******, that I would ***** them from being *******. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.' 

'Let it rest with Rose, then,' interposed Harry.  'You will not ***** these ************ ******** of *****, so far, as to ***** any ******** in my way?' 

'I will not,' rejoined Mrs. Maylie; 'but I would have you ********--' 

'I _have_ considered!' was the ********* reply; 'Mother, I have considered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I have been ******* of ******* **********.  My feelings ****** *********, as they ever will; and why should I ****** the pain of a ***** in giving them ****, which can be ********** of no ******* good?  No!  Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.' 

'She shall,' said Mrs. Maylie. 

'There is something in your manner, which would almost ***** that she will hear me ******, mother,' said the young man. 

'Not ******,' rejoined the old lady; 'far from it.' 

'How then?' ***** the young man.  'She has ****** no other **********?' 

'No, indeed,' replied his mother; 'you have, or I *******, too strong a hold on her ********** already.  What I would say,' resumed the old lady, stopping her *** as he was about to speak, 'is this.  Before you ***** your all on this ******; before you ****** yourself to be carried to the ******* point of hope; ******* for a few moments, my dear child, on ****'* history, and ******** what effect the ********* of her ******** birth may have on her ********:  ******* as she is to us, with all the ********* of her ***** mind, and with that ******* ********* of **** which, in all matters, great or ********, has always been her 



'What do you mean?' 

'That I leave you to ********,' replied Mrs. Maylie.  'I must go back to her.  God bless you!' 

'I shall see you again to-night?' said the young man, eagerly. 

'By and by,' replied the lady; 'when I leave Rose.' 

'You will tell her I am here?' said Harry. 

'Of course,' replied Mrs. Maylie. 

'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have ********, and how I long to see her.  You will not ****** to do this, mother?' 

'No,' said the old lady; 'I will tell her all.'  And ******** her ***'* hand, **************, she ******** from the room. 

Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the ********* while this hurried conversation was **********.  The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and ****** *********** were ********* between them.  The doctor then ************, in reply to ************ ********* from his young friend, a ******* account of his *******'* *********; which was quite as *********** and full of promise, as Oliver's ********* had ********** him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who ******** to be **** about the *******, listened with ****** ears. 

'Have you **** anything particular, ******, Giles?' inquired the doctor, when he had *********. 

'Nothing particular, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, ********* up to the eyes. 

'Nor catching any *******, nor *********** any *****-********?' said the doctor. 

'None at all, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, with much *******. 

'Well,' said the doctor, 'I am ***** to hear it, because you do that sort of thing *********.  Pray, how is Brittles?' 

'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, ********** his usual tone of *********; 'and ***** his ********** ****, sir.' 

'That's well,' said the doctor.  'Seeing you here, ******* me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so *********, I ********, at the ******* of your good ********, a small ********** in your ******.  Just step into this corner a moment, will 



Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much **********, and some wonder, and was ******** with a short ********** ********** with the doctor, on the *********** of which, he made a great many ****, and ******* with steps of ******* ***********.  The subject matter of this ********** was not ********* in the parlour, but the kitchen was ******** *********** ********** it; for Mr. Giles walked straight *******, and having called for a *** of ***, *********, with an air of *******, which was ****** *********, that it had ******* his ********, in consideration of his ******* ********* on the occasion of that ********* robbery, to *******, in the ***** *******-****, the *** of ****-***-****** pounds, for his **** use and *******.  At this, the two *****-******** ****** up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, ******* out his *****-*****, replied, 'No, no'; and that if they observed that he was at all ******* to his *********, he would thank them to tell him so.  And then he made a great many other *******, no less ************ of his ********, which were received with ***** ****** and ********, and were, ******, as ******** and as much to the purpose, as the ******* of great men ******** are. 

Above stairs, the ********* of the evening passed ********** away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however ******** or ********** Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman's good ******, which ********* itself in a great ******* of ******* and ************ *************, and an ********* of small *****, which struck Oliver as being the ******** things he had ever heard, and ****** him to laugh ***************; to the ******* satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed ************ at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as ********, by the very force of ********. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they *******, with light and ******** ******, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and ******** they had ******** *********, they stood much in need. 

Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual ***********, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.  The ***** were once more hung out, to ****, in their old ******; and the ******** **** ******* that could be found, were once more ******** to ******* Rose with their ******. The ********** which had seemed to the *** eyes of the anxious boy to ****, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was ********* by *****.  The *** seemed to ******* more ******** on the green ******; the air to ****** among them with a ******* *****; and the *** itself to look more **** and bright. Such is the ********* which the condition of our own thoughts, ********, even over the appearance of ******** *******.  Men who look on nature, and their ******-***, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the ****** ******* are *********** from their own ********* eyes and ******.  The real **** are ********, and need a ******* ******. 

It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not **** to **** it at the time, that his morning *********** were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he *** Oliver coming ***** home, was ****** with such a passion for *******, and ********* such a ***** in their ***********, as left his young companion far behind.  If Oliver were ********** in these ********, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they ******* the country together, and brought home the ******* that *********.  The window of the young ****'* ******* was opened now; for she ***** to feel the **** ****** air ****** in, and ****** her with its *********; but there always stood in water, just inside the *******, one particular little *****, which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver could not help ******** that the ******** ******* were never ****** away, although the little **** was ********* ***********; nor, could he help *********, that ******** the doctor came into the ******, he ********** cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most ************, as he set forth on his *******'* walk.  ******* these ************, the days were ****** by; and Rose was ******* **********. 

Nor did Oliver's time **** heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her *******, and there were no evening *****, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He ******* himself, with ********* *********, to the ************ of the *****-****** old gentleman, and ******** so hard that his quick ******** ********* even himself.  It was while he was ******* in this *******, that he was ******* ******** and ********** by a most ********** **********. 

The little room in which he was ********** to sit, when **** at his books, was on the ******-*****, at the back of the house.  It was quite a *******-****, with a *******-******: ****** which were ******** of ********* and ***********, that crept over the ********, and filled the place with their ********* *******.  It looked into a ******, ****** a ******-**** opened into a small *******; all beyond, was fine ******-**** and ****.  There was no other ******** near, in that direction; and the ******** it ********* was very *********. 

One beautiful evening, when the first ****** of ******** were ********* to ****** upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, ****** upon his books.  He had been ****** over them for some time; and, as the day had been ********** ******, and he had ******* himself a great deal, it is no ************* to the *******, ******* they may have been, to say, that gradually and by **** *******, he fell ******. 

There is a kind of sleep that ****** upon us sometimes, which, while it ***** the body ********, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and ****** it to ****** at its pleasure.  So far as an ************ *********, a *********** of strength, and an ***** ********* to ******* our thoughts or power of ******, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a ************* of all that is going on about us, and, if we ***** at such a time, words which are really spoken, or ****** which really ***** at the moment, *********** themselves with ********** ********* to our *******, until ******* and *********** become so ********* ******* that it is afterwards almost matter of ************* to ******** the two.  Nor is this, the most ******** ********** ********** to such a state.  It is an ********* fact, that although our ****** of ***** and sight be for the time dead, yet our ******** thoughts, and the ********* ****** that **** before us, will be ********** and ********** **********, by the _mere silent presence_ of some ******** object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes:  and of whose ******** we have had no ****** 



Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was ******** among the ******** ****** outside.  And yet he was ******. Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and ********; and he thought, with a **** of ******, that he was in the Jew's house again. There sat the ******* old man, in his ********** corner, pointing at him, and ********** to another man, with his face *******, who sat ****** him. 

'Hush, my dear!' he thought he heard the Jew say; 'it is he, sure enough.  Come away.' 

'He!' the other man seemed to answer; 'could I ******* him, think you? If a crowd of ****** were to put themselves into his ***** *****, and he stood ******* them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out.  If you ****** him ***** feet deep, and took me across his grave, I ***** I should know, if there wasn't a **** above it, that he lay ****** there?' 

The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful ******, that Oliver ***** with the fear, and started up. 

Good Heaven!  what was that, which sent the blood ******** to his heart, and ******** him of his voice, and of power to ****! *****--*****--** the ******--***** before ***--** close, that he could have almost ******* him before he started back:  with his eyes ******* into the room, and ******* his:  there stood the Jew!  And ****** him, white with **** or fear, or both, were the ******** features of the man who had ******** him in the ***-****. 

It was but an instant, a glance, a *****, before his eyes; and they were gone.  But they had ********** him, and he them; and their look was as firmly ********* upon his ******, as if it had been ****** ****** in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood ********** for a moment; then, ******* from the window into the ******, called ****** for help. 





CHAPTER **** 

********** THE ************** ****** OF OLIVER'S *********; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME ********** BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE 

When the ******* of the house, ********* by Oliver's *****, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and ********, pointing in the direction of the ******* behind the house, and scarcely able to ********** the words, 'The Jew! the Jew!' 

Mr. Giles was at a loss to ********** what this ****** *****; but Harry Maylie, whose *********** were something *******, and who had heard Oliver's history from his mother, ********** it at once. 

'What direction did he take?' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. 

'That,' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; 'I ****** them in an instant.' 

'Then, they are in the ditch!' said Harry.  'Follow!  And keep as near me, as you can.' So saying, he ****** over the *****, and ****** off with a ***** which rendered it matter of ********* ********** for the others to keep near him. 

Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, ******* over the ***** after them, and ******* himself up with more ******* than he could have been supposed to *******, struck into the same course at no ************ *****, ******** all the while, most ************, to know what was the matter. 

On they all went; nor stopped they once to *******, until the ******, ******** off into an ***** of the ***** ********* by Oliver, began to ******, ********, the ditch and ***** *********; which ******** time for the ********* of the party to come up; and for Oliver to *********** to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so ******** a *******. 

The ****** was all in ****.  There were not even the ****** of ****** *********, to be seen.  They stood now, on the ****** of a little hill, ********** the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the ******* in the ****** on the left; but, in order to **** that, after ******** the ***** Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a ******* of open ground, which it was ********** they could have ************ in so short a time.  A thick **** ******* the ******-**** in another direction; but they could not have ****** that ****** for the same reason. 

'It must have been a *****, Oliver,' said Harry Maylie. 

'Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied Oliver, ********** at the very ************ of the old ******'* countenance; 'I saw him too ******* for that.  I saw them both, as ******* as I see you now.' 

'Who was the other?' inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together. 

'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the ***,' said Oliver.  'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could ***** to him.' 

'They took this way?' demanded Harry:  'are you sure?' 

'As I am that the men were at the window,' replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the ***** which ******* the *******-****** from the ******.  'The **** man ****** over, just there; and the Jew, running a few ***** to the right, crept through that ***.' 

The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel ********* of the ******** of what he said.  Still, in no direction were there any *********** of the ********* of men in hurried ******.  The ***** was long; but it was ******* down *******, save where their own feet had ******* it.  The ***** and ****** of the ******* were of **** ****; but in no one place could they ******* the ***** of ***'* *****, or the ********* **** which would ******** that any feet had ******* the ground for hours before. 

'This is strange!' said Harry. 

'Strange?' ****** the doctor.  'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.' 

*************** the ********* ******* nature of their ******, they did not ****** until the coming on of night rendered its further *********** ********; and even then, they gave it up with **********. Giles was ********** to the different ***-****** in the *******, ********* with the best *********** Oliver could give of the appearance and ***** of the *********.  Of these, the Jew was, at all ******, ************ ********** to be **********, ********* he had been seen ********, or ********* about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, ********** to ****** or ****** the *******. 

On the next day, fresh ****** was made, and the ********* *******; but with no better *******.  On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie ******** to the ******-****, in the hope of seeing or ******* something of the men there; but this effort was ******* *********.  After a few days, the ****** began to be *********, as most ******* are, when wonder, having no fresh **** to ******* it, **** away of itself. 

Meanwhile, Rose was ******* **********.  She had left her room: was able to go out; and ****** once more with the family, carried joy into the ****** of all. 

But, although this happy change had a ******* effect on the little ******; and although ******** ****** and merry ******** were once more heard in the *******; there was at times, an ******** ********* upon some there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not **** to remark.  Mrs. Maylie and her *** were often ******** together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with ****** of tears upon her face.  After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his ********* to ********, these ******** *********; and it became ******* that something was in ******** which ******** the ***** of the young lady, and of somebody else besides. 

At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the *********-*******, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some **********, ****** ********** to speak with her for a few moments. 

'A ***--* very ***--**** *******, Rose,' said the young man, drawing his chair towards her.  'What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most ********* ***** of my heart are not ******* to you, though from my lips you have not heard them ******.' 

Rose had been very pale from the moment of his ********; but that might have been the effect of her ****** *******.  She merely *****; and ******* over some ****** that stood near, ****** in silence for him to 



'*--*--***** to have left here, before,' said Harry. 

'You should, indeed,' replied Rose.  '******* me for saying so, but I wish you had.' 

'I was brought here, by the most dreadful and ********* of all *************,' said the young man; 'the fear of ****** the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.  You had been *****; trembling between earth and heaven.  We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are ******* with ********, their **** spirits ********** turn towards their bright home of ******* rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and ******* of our kind, too often **** in ********.' 

There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the ****** over which she ****, and ********* ******** in its ***, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the ********** of her fresh young heart, ******* ******* *********, with the ********* things in nature. 

'A creature,' continued the young man, ************, 'a creature as **** and ******** of ***** as one of ***'* own ******, ********* between life and death.  Oh! who could hope, when the ******* world to which she was ****, half opened to her view, that she would return to the ****** and ******** of this!  Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some **** ******, which a light from above, ***** upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be ****** to those who ****** here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you ******** to that bright ****** ******* so many of the ******* and the best have ****** their early ******; and yet to pray, **** all these ************, that you might be ******** to those who ***** ***--***** were ************ almost too great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a ******* ******* of *****, and *************, and ******* *******, **** you should die, and never know how ********* I ***** you, as almost **** down sense and reason in its course.  You *********. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of ****** came back, and ******** with the ***** and ****** ****** of life which ********** ********* within you, ******* it again to a high and ******* ****.  I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned ***** with their ********* and deep *********. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has ******** my heart to all *******.' 

'I did not mean that,' said Rose, *******; 'I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and ***** ******** again; to ******** well worthy of you.' 

'There is no ******* more worthy of me:  more worthy of the ******* nature that ******:  than the ******** to *** such a heart as *****,' said the young man, taking her hand. 'Rose, my own dear Rose!  For *****--*** *****--* have ***** you; ****** to *** my way to ****, and then come ******* home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to *****; thinking, in my *********, how I would ****** you, in that happy moment, of the many silent ****** I had given of a boy's **********, and ***** your hand, as in ********** of some old **** ******** that had been ****** between us!  That time has not arrived; but here, with not **** ***, and no young ****** ********, I ***** you the heart so long your own, and ***** my all upon the words with which you ***** the 



'Your ********* has ever been kind and *****.' said Rose, ********* the ******** by which she was ********.  'As you believe that I am not ********** or **********, so hear my answer.' 

'It is, that I may ********* to ******* you; it is, dear Rose?' 

'It is,' replied Rose, 'that you must ********* to ****** me; not as your old and ******-******** companion, for that would ***** me ******; but, as the object of your love.  Look into the world; think how many ****** you would be ***** to ****, are there. ******* some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the ******, *******, and most ******** friend you have.' 

There was a *****, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free **** to her tears.  Harry still ******** the other. 

'And your *******, Rose,' he said, at length, in a low voice; 'your ******* for this ********?' 

'You have a right to know them,' rejoined Rose.  'You can say nothing to ***** my **********.  It is a **** that I must *******.  I *** it, ***** to others, and to myself.' 

'To yourself?' 

'Yes, Harry.  I *** it to myself, that I, a **********, ***********, girl, with a ****** upon my name, should not give your friends reason to ******* that I had ******** ******* to your first passion, and ******** myself, a ****, on all your ***** and ********.  I *** it to you and *****, to ******* you from ********, in the ****** of your ******** nature, this great ******** to your ******** in the world.' 

'If your ************ ***** with your sense of ****--' Harry began. 

'They do not,' replied Rose, ********* ******. 

'Then you return my love?' said Harry.  'Say but that, dear Rose; say but that; and ****** the ********** of this hard **************!' 

'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I *****,' rejoined Rose, 'I could have--' 

'Have received this *********** very ***********?' said Harry. 'Do not ******* that from me, at least, Rose.' 

'I could,' said Rose.  '****!' she added, *********** her hand, 'why should we ******* this ******* *********?  Most ******* to me, and yet ********** of ******* happiness, ***************; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your ****** which I now ******, and every ******* you ******* in life will ******* me with new ********* and ********.  ********, Harry!  As we have *** **-***, we **** no more; but in other ********* than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and ******* ********; and may every ******** that the ******* of a true and earnest heart can call down from the ****** of all truth and *********, ***** and ******* 



'Another word, Rose,' said Harry.  'Your reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!' 

'The ******** before you,' answered Rose, firmly, 'is a ********* one. All the ******* to which great ******* and ******** *********** can help men in public life, are in ***** for you. But those *********** are *****; and I will neither ****** with such as may hold in ***** the mother who gave me life; nor bring ******** or ******* on the *** of her who has so well ******** that ******'* place.  In a word,' said the young lady, turning away, as her ********* ******** ******* her, 'there is a ***** upon my name, which the world ****** on ******** heads.  I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the ******** shall rest alone on me.' 

'One word more, Rose.  ******* Rose! one more!' cried Harry, ******** himself before her.  'If I had been ****--**** *********, the world would call **--** some ******* and ******** life had been my *******--** I had been poor, sick, ********--***** you have turned from me then?  Or has my ******** *********** to ****** and honour, given this ******* birth?' 

'Do not ***** me to reply,' answered Rose.  'The question does not *****, and never will.  It is ******, almost ******, to **** it.' 

'If your answer be what I almost **** to hope it is,' retorted Harry, 'it will **** a ***** of happiness upon my ****** way, and light the **** before me.  It is not an **** thing to do so much, by the ********* of a few brief words, for one who ***** you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the name of my ****** and ******** **********; in the name of all I have ******** for you, and all you **** me to *******; answer me this one question!' 

'Then, if your *** had been *********** cast,' rejoined Rose; 'if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and ******* to you in any ****** scene of ***** and **********, and not a **** and ******** in ********* and ************* ******; I should have been ****** this *****.  I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been *******.' 

**** ************* of old *****, ********* as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this ******; but they brought tears with them, as old ***** will when they come back ********; and they ******** her. 

'I cannot help this ********, and it ***** my purpose ********,' said Rose, ********* her hand.  'I must leave you now, indeed.' 

'I ask one promise,' said Harry.  'Once, and only once ****,--*** within a year, but it may be much ******,--* may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.' 

'Not to ***** me to ***** my right *************,' replied Rose, with a ********** smile; 'it will be *******.' 

'No,' said Harry; 'to hear you ****** it, if you ****--******* ****** it!  I will lay at your feet, ******** of ******* of ******* I may *******; and if you still ****** to your present **********, will not ****, by word or ***, to change it.' 

'Then let it be so,' rejoined Rose; 'it is but one **** the more, and by that time I may be ******* to bear it better.' 

She ******** her hand again.  But the young man caught her to his *****; and ********** one **** on her beautiful ********, hurried from the room. 





CHAPTER ***** 

IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY ****** OF NO GREAT ********** IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ ***************, AS A ****** TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ******* 

'And so you are resolved to be my ********** companion this morning; eh?' said the doctor, as Harry Maylie ****** him and Oliver at the *********-*****.  'Why, you are not in the same mind or ********* two ****-***** together!' 

'You will tell me a different **** one of these days,' said Harry, ********* without any *********** reason. 

'I hope I may have good cause to do so,' replied Mr. Losberne; 'though I ******* I don't think I shall.  But ********* morning you had made up your mind, in a great *****, to **** here, and to ********* your mother, like a ******* ***, to the ***-****. Before ****, you ******** that you are going to do me the honour of ************ me as far as I go, on your road to London.  And at night, you **** me, with great *******, to ***** before the ladies are ********; the *********** of which is, that young Oliver here is ****** down to his ********* when he ought to be ******* the ******* after ********* ********* of all *****. Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?' 

'I should have been very ***** not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver. 

'That's a fine fellow,' said the doctor; 'you shall come and see me when you return.  But, to speak *********, Harry; has any ************* from the great **** ******** this sudden ******* on your part to be 



'The great ****,' replied Harry, 'under which ***********, I *******, you ******* my most ******* *****, have not ************ with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it ****** that anything would ***** to ****** necessary my ********* ********** among them.' 

'Well,' said the doctor, 'you are a ***** fellow.  But of course they will get you into ********** at the ******** before *********, and these sudden ********* and ******* are no bad *********** for ********* life.  There's something in that.  Good ******** is always *********, whether the **** be for place, ***, or ***********.' 

Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short ******** by one or two ******* that would have ********* the doctor not a little; but he ********* himself with saying, 'We shall see,' and pursued the subject no *******.  The ****-****** ***** up to the door ******* afterwards; and Giles coming in for the *******, the good doctor ******* out, to see it ******. 

'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, 'let me speak a word with 



Oliver walked into the ******-****** to which Mr. Maylie ******** him; much ********* at the ******* of ******* and ********** spirits, which his whole ********* *********. 

'You can ***** well now?' said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm. 

'I hope so, sir,' replied Oliver. 

'I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would ***** to **--*** once a ****-*****:  every ********* ******: to the ******* **** Office in London.  Will you?' 

'Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be ***** to do it,' exclaimed Oliver, ******* ********* with the **********. 

'I should like to know ***--*** my mother and Miss Maylie are,' said the young man; 'and you can **** up a ***** by ******* me what ***** you take, and what you talk about, and whether ***--****, I ****--**** happy and quite well. You understand me?' 

'Oh! quite, sir, quite,' replied Oliver. 

'I would rather you did not ******* it to them,' said Harry, ******** over his words; 'because it might make my mother anxious to ***** to me *******, and it is a trouble and ***** to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!  I ****** upon 



Oliver, quite ****** and ******** by a sense of his **********, ********** ******** to be secret and ******** in his **************. Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many ********** of his ****** and 



The doctor was in the ******; Giles (who, it had been ********, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the *****-******** were in the ******, looking on.  Harry cast one slight glance at the ******** window, and ****** into the ********. 

'***** on!' he cried, 'hard, fast, full ******!  Nothing short of ****** will keep pace with me, **-***.' 

'******!' cried the doctor, ******* down the front glass in a great *****, and ******** to the **********; 'something very short of ****** will keep pace with _me_.  Do you hear?' 

******** and **********, till distance rendered its noise *********, and its ***** ******** only *********** to the eye, the ******* ***** its way along the road, almost ****** in a ***** of ****: now ****** ************, and now ******** ******* again, as *********** *******, or the *********** of the way, *********.  It was not until even the ***** ***** was no longer to be seen, that the ****** *********. 

And there was one ******-**, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the ******** had ***********, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white ******* which had ******** her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself. 

'He ***** in high spirits and happy,' she said, at length. 'I ****** for a time he might be *********.  I was ********.  I am very, very 



Tears are ***** of ******** as well as *****; but those which ******* down ****'* face, as she sat ********* at the window, still ****** in the same direction, seemed to tell more of ****** than of joy. 





CHAPTER ****** 

IN WHICH THE ****** MAY ******** A ********, NOT ******** IN *********** ***** 

Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes ******* fixed on the ********* *****, ******, as it was ****** time, no ******** ***** proceeded, than the ********** of certain ****** **** of the ***, which were sent back from its cold and ******* *******.  A paper ***-**** ******* from the *******, to which he ************ raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the ******** ******* ******* round the ***** ***-****, Mr. Bumble would ***** a deep ****, while a more gloomy ****** ********** his countenance.  Mr. Bumble was **********; it might be that the ******* brought to mind, some ******* passage in his own past life. 

Nor was Mr. Bumble's ***** the only thing ********** to ****** a ******** ********** in the ***** of a *********. There were not ******* other ***********, and those ******* ********* with his own person, which ********* that a great change had taken place in the position of his *******.  The ***** coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?  He still **** ****-********, and dark ****** ********* on his ****** *****; but they were not _the_ ********.  The coat was ****-*******; and in that ******* like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!  The ****** cocked hat was ******** by a ****** round one.  Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle. 

There are some ********** in life, which, *********** of the more *********** ******* they *****, ******* ******** ***** and ******* from the ***** and ********** ********* with them.  A *****-******* has his *******; a ****** his **** *****; a ********** his **** ****; a beadle his cocked hat.  ***** the ****** of his *****, or the beadle of his hat and ****; what are they?  Men.  Mere men.  *******, and even ******** too, sometimes, are more ********* of coat and waistcoat than some people *******. 

Mr. Bumble had ******* Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. Another beadle had come into power.  On him the cocked hat, ****-***** coat, and *****, had all three *********. 

'And to-morrow two months it was done!' said Mr. Bumble, with a ****. 'It ***** a age.' 

Mr. Bumble might have ***** that he had ************ a whole ********* of happiness into the short space of ***** *****; but the ****--***** was a **** deal of ******* in the ****. 

'I **** myself,' said Mr. Bumble, ******** the same ***** of *********, 'for six *********, a pair of *****-*****, and a ****-***; with a small ******** of ******-**** *********, and twenty pound in money.  I went very **********.  *****, **** *****!' 

'*****!' cried a ****** voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: 'you would have been dear at any *****; and dear enough I **** for you, **** above knows 



Mr. Bumble turned, and *********** the face of his *********** *******, who, *********** ************* the few words she had ********* of his *********, had ******** the ********* remark at a *******. 

'Mrs. Bumble, ma'am!' said Mr. Bumble, with a *********** *********. 

'Well!' cried the lady. 

'Have the goodness to look at me,' said Mr. Bumble, ****** his eyes upon her.  (If she ****** such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to himself, 'she can stand anything.  It is a eye I never knew to **** with paupers.  If it ***** with her, my power is gone.') 

Whether an *********** small ********* of eye be ********** to ***** paupers, who, being ******* ***, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was ************ proof against ***** *******; are matters of opinion.  The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way *********** by Mr. Bumble's *****, but, on the ********, ******* it with great *******, and even raised a laugh *******, which ******* as though it were *******. 

On ******* this most ********** sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first ***********, and afterwards ******.  He then ******** into his former state; nor did he ***** himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his *******. 

'Are you going to sit ******* there, all day?' inquired Mrs. Bumble. 

'I am going to sit here, as long as I think ******, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble; 'and although I was _not_ *******, I shall *****, ****, ******, laugh, or cry, as the ****** ******* me; such being my 



'_Your_ ***********!' ******* Mrs. Bumble, with ********* ********. 

'I said the word, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble.  'The *********** of a man is to *******.' 

'And what's the *********** of a woman, in the name of Goodness?' cried the ****** of Mr. Corney ********. 

'To ****, ma'am,' ********* Mr. Bumble.  'Your late *********** ******* should have ****** it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.  I wish he was, poor man!' 

Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the ******** moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the ********** on one side or other, must *********** be ***** and **********, no sooner heard this ******** to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud ****** that Mr. Bumble was a ****-******* *****, fell into a ******** of tears. 

But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul; his heart was **********.  Like ******** ****** **** that ******* with rain, his ****** were rendered ******* and more ********, by ******* of tears, which, being ****** of ********, and so far ***** ********** of his own power, ******* and ******* him.  He **** his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and ******, in an *********** manner, that she should cry her *******:  the ******** being looked upon, by the *******, as ******** ********* to ******. 

'It ***** the *****, ****** the countenance, ********* the eyes, and ******* down the ******,' said Mr. Bumble.  'So cry away.' 

As he ********** himself of this **********, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a ***, and putting it on, rather ********, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had ******** his *********** in a ******** manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and ********* towards the door, with much **** and *********** ******** in his whole appearance. 

Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less *********** than a ****** *******; but, she was quite ******** to make ***** of the latter **** of **********, as Mr. Bumble was not long in 



The first proof he *********** of the fact, was ******** in a ****** sound, immediately ********* by the sudden ****** off of his hat to the opposite end of the room.  This *********** ********** laying **** his head, the ****** lady, ******** him ******* round the throat with one hand, ********* a ****** of ***** (***** with ******** ****** and *********) upon it with the other.  This done, she ******* a little ******* by ********** his face, and ******* his hair; and, having, by this time, ********* as much ********** as she ****** necessary for the *******, she ****** him over a chair, which was ******* well ******** for the purpose:  and ****** him to talk about his *********** again, if he *****. 

'Get up!' said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of *******.  'And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.' 

Mr. Bumble rose with a very ****** countenance:  ********* much what something desperate might be.  ******* up his hat, he looked towards the door. 

'Are you going?' demanded Mrs. Bumble. 

'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a ******* ****** towards the door.  'I didn't ****** **--*'* going, my dear!  You are so very violent, that really I--' 

At this instant, Mrs. Bumble ******* hastily forward to ******* the ******, which had been ****** up in the *******.  Mr. Bumble immediately ****** out of the room, without ********* another thought on his ********** ********:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full ********** of the *****. 

Mr. Bumble was ****** taken by surprise, and ****** ******.  He had a ******* ********** for ********:  ******* no ************** pleasure from the ******** of ***** *******; and, ************, was (it is ******** to say) a ******.  This is by no means a ************* to his *********; for many ******** **********, who are held in high ******* and **********, are the ******* of ******* ***********.  The remark is made, indeed, rather in his ****** than *********, and with a view of ********** the ****** with a just sense of his ************** for 



But, the ******* of his *********** was not yet full.  After making a **** of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the ****-**** really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their *****, leaving them ********** to the parish, ought, in justice to be ******* with no ********** at all, but rather ******** as *********** *********** who had ******** much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were ******* ******** in ******* the parish *****:  when the sound of ****** in conversation, now proceeded. 

'***!' said Mr. Bumble, ********* up all his ****** *******. 'These women at least shall ******** to ******* the ***********. *****! ***** there!  What do you mean by this noise, you *******?' 

With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very ****** and ***** manner:  which was at once ********* for a most ********** and ******** air, as his eyes ************ ****** on the form of his lady wife. 

'My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, 'I didn't know you were here.' 

'Didn't know I was here!' repeated Mrs. Bumble.  'What do _you_ do 



'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work ********, my dear,' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing ************ at a couple of old women at the ****-***, who were ********* ***** of ********** at the *********-******'* ********. 

'_You_ thought they were talking too much?' said Mrs. Bumble. 'What business is it of *****?' 

'Why, my dear--' ***** Mr. Bumble ************. 

'What business is it of *****?' demanded Mrs. Bumble, again. 

'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' ********* Mr. Bumble; 'but I thought you ******'* be in the way just then.' 

'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,' returned his lady.  'We don't want any of your ************.  You're a great deal too **** of ****** your nose into things that don't ******* you, making ********* in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a **** every hour in the day.  Be off; come!' 

Mr. Bumble, seeing with ************ feelings, the ******* of the two old paupers, who were ********* together most ***********, ********* for an instant.  Mrs. Bumble, whose ******** ******* no *****, caught up a **** of ****-****, and ********* him towards the door, ******* him ********* to ******, on pain of ********* the ******** upon his ****** 



What could Mr. Bumble do?  He looked ********** round, and ***** away; and, as he reached the door, the ********** of the paupers ***** into a ****** ******* of ************* *******.  It wanted but this.  He was ******** in their eyes; he had lost ***** and ******* before the very paupers; he had ****** from all the ****** and **** of **********, to the ****** ***** of the most ******* ***-*******. 

'All in two months!' said Mr. Bumble, filled with ****** thoughts. 'Two months!  No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but ********* ****'*, so far as the porochial workhouse was *********, and now!--' 

It was too much.  Mr. Bumble ***** the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the ****** in his *******); and walked, ************, into the street. 

He walked up one street, and down another, until ******** had ****** the first passion of his *****; and then the ********* of feeling made him *******.  He passed a great many ******-******; but, at length paused before one in a **-***, whose parlour, as he ******** from a ***** **** over the ******, was ********, save by one ******** ********.  It began to rain, *******, at the moment.  This determined him.  Mr. Bumble ******* in; and ******** something to drink, as he passed the ***, entered the ********* into which he had looked from the 



The man who was seated there, was **** and dark, and **** a large *****.  He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain *********** in his look, as well as by the ***** ***** on his *****, to have ********* some distance.  He **** Bumble *******, as he entered, but scarcely ******* to *** his head in ************** of his 



Mr. Bumble had quite ******* enough for two; ********* even that the stranger had been more ********:  so he ***** his ***-***-***** in silence, and read the paper with great show of **** and ************. 

It so happened, however: as it will ****** very often, when men **** into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a ******** **********, which he could not ******, to ***** a look at the stranger:  and that ******** he did so, he ******** his eyes, in some *********, to find that the stranger was at that moment ******** a look at him.  Mr. Bumble's *********** was ******** by the very ********** expression of the ********'* eye, which was **** and bright, but ******** by a ***** of ******** and *********, ****** anything he had ever observed before, and ********* to ******. 

When they had *********** each other's glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a *****, deep voice, ***** silence. 

'Were you looking for me,' he said, 'when you ****** in at the window?' 

'Not that I am ***** of, unless you're Mr.--'  Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was ******* to know the ********'* name, and thought in his **********, he might ****** the *****. 

'I see you were not,' said the stranger; an expression of quiet ******* ******* about his mouth; 'or you have known my name.  You don't know it.  I would ********* you not to ask for it.' 

'I ***** no ****, young man,' observed Mr. Bumble, ************. 

'And have done none,' said the stranger. 

Another silence ********* this short ********:  which was again broken by the stranger. 

'I have seen you before, I think?' said he.  'You were *********** ******* at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again.  You were beadle here, once; were you not?' 

'I was,' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; 'porochial beadle.' 

'Just so,' rejoined the other, ******* his head.  'It was in that ********* I saw you.  What are you now?' 

'Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and ************, to ***** any ***** *********** the stranger might ********* ******.  'Master of the workhouse, young man!' 

'You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?' resumed the stranger, looking ****** into Mr. Bumble's eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question. 

'Don't ******* to answer ******, man.  I know you pretty well, you see.' 

'I suppose, a ******* man,' replied Mr. Bumble, ******* his eyes with his hand, and ********* the stranger, from head to foot, in ******* **********, 'is not more ****** to turning an ****** ***** when he can, than a ****** one.  Porochial ******** are not so well **** that they can ****** to ****** any little ***** ***, when it comes to them in a ***** and ****** manner.' 

The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not ******** his man; then **** the bell. 

'**** this glass again,' he said, ******* Mr. Bumble's empty ******* to the ********.  'Let it be strong and ***.  You like it so, I suppose?' 

'Not too strong,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a ******** *****. 

'You understand what that means, ********!' said the stranger, *****. 

The **** smiled, ***********, and ******* afterwards returned with a ******** *****: of which, the first **** brought the water into Mr. Bumble's eyes. 

'Now listen to me,' said the stranger, after ******* the door and window.  'I came down to this place, **-***, to find you out; and, by one of those ******* which the devil ****** in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were ********* in my mind.  I want some *********** from you.  I don't ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.  Put up that, to ***** 



As he spoke, he ****** a couple of ********** across the table to his companion, carefully, as though ********* that the ******** of money should be heard without.  When Mr. Bumble had ************ ******** the *****, to see that they were *******, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his *********-******, he went on: 

'Carry your ****** ****--*** me ***--****** years, last ******.' 

'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble.  'Very good.  I've done it.' 

'The scene, the workhouse.' 





'And the time, night.' 





'And the place, the ***** ****, ******** it was, in which ********* ***** brought forth the life and ****** so often ****** to **********--**** birth to ****** children for the parish to ****; and *** their *****, *** 'em in the grave!' 

'The *****-** room, I suppose?' said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the ********'* ******* ***********. 

'Yes,' said the stranger.  'A boy was born there.' 

'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, ************. 

'A ******* on the young ******!' cried the stranger; 'I speak of one; a ****-*******, ****-***** boy, who was *********** down here, to a ******-*****--* wish he had made his coffin, and ******* his body in **--*** who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed. 

'Why, you mean Oliver!  Young Twist!' said Mr. Bumble; 'I ******** him, of course.  There wasn't a ********** young ******--' 

'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the ****** of a ****** on the subject of poor Oliver's *****.  'It's of a woman; the *** that ****** his mother.  Where is she?' 

'Where is she?' said Mr. Bumble, whom the ***-***-***** had rendered *********.  'It would be hard to tell.  There's no ********* there, ********* place she's gone to; so I suppose she's out of **********, 



'What do you mean?' demanded the stranger, *******. 

'That she died last ******,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. 

The man looked ******* at him when he had given this ***********, and although he did not ******** his eyes for some time afterwards, his **** gradually became ****** and **********, and he seemed lost in thought.  For some time, he appeared ******** whether he ought to be ******** or ************ by the intelligence; but at length he ******** more ******; and *********** his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to ******. 

But Mr. Bumble was ******* enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the ********* ******** of some secret in the ********** of his better half.  He well ********** the night of old *****'* death, which the *********** of that day had given him good reason to *********, as the occasion on which he had ******** to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never ******** to him the ********** of which she had been the ******** *******, he had heard enough to know that it ******* to something that had ******** in the old *****'* **********, as workhouse *****, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily ******* this ************ to mind, he ******** the stranger, with an air of *******, that one woman had been ******** with the old ******** ******* before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, ***** some light on the subject of his inquiry. 

'How can I find her?' said the stranger, ****** off his *****; and ******* ******* that all his ***** (******** they were) were ******* ****** by the intelligence. 

'Only through me,' rejoined Mr. Bumble. 

'When?' cried the stranger, hastily. 

'To-morrow,' rejoined Bumble. 

'At **** in the evening,' said the stranger, ********* a ***** of paper, and ******* down upon it, an ******* ******* by the *****-****, in ********** that ******** his *********; 'at **** in the evening, bring her to me there.  I *****'* tell you to be secret.  It's your 



With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the ****** that had been *****.  ******* ********* that their ***** were different, he ********, without more ******** than an ******** ********** of the hour of *********** for the following night. 

On glancing at the *******, the ********* *********** observed that it ********* no name.  The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it. 

'What do you want?' cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble ******* him on the arm.  'Following me?' 

'Only to ask a question,' said the other, pointing to the ***** of paper.  'What name am I to ask for?' 

'Monks!' rejoined the man; and ****** hastily, away. 





CHAPTER ******* 

********** AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR ********* ********* 

It was a ****, close, ******** ****** evening.  The ******, which had been *********** all day, ****** out in a ***** and ******** **** of ******, already ******* large ***** of rain, and seemed to ******* a violent *******-*****, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the **** street of the town, ******** their course towards a ********* little ****** of ******* houses, ******* from it some **** and *-****, or ***********, and ******* on a low *********** *****, ********* upon the *****. 

They were both ******* in old and ****** ***** ********, which might, perhaps, ***** the ****** purpose of ********** their ******* from the rain, and ********** them from ***********.  The ******* carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet *****; and ******* on, a few ***** in front, as ******--*** way being *****--** give his wife the ******* of ******** in his heavy **********.  They went on, in ******** silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble ******* his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his ******** was following; then, *********** that she was close at his *****, he ****** his **** of walking, and proceeded, at a ************ ******** of *****, towards their place of ***********. 

This was far from being a place of ******** *********; for it had long been known as the ********* of none but low ********, who, under various ********* of living by their ******, ********* ******* on ******* and *****.  It was a ********** of mere ******:  some, hastily ***** with ***** ******: others, of old ****-***** ****-******: ******* together without any ******* at order or ***********, and *******, for the most part, within a few feet of the *****'* ****.  A few ***** ***** drawn up on the ***, and made fast to the ***** wall which ******* it:  and here and there an *** or **** of ****:  appeared, at first, to ******** that the *********** of these ********* ******** pursued some ********* on the *****; but a glance at the ********* and ******* condition of the ******** thus *********, would have led a ******-**, without much **********, to the ********** that they were disposed there, rather for the ************ of ***********, than with any view to their being ******** ********. 

In the heart of this ******* of ****; and ******** the *****, which its ***** ******* ********; stood a large ********, ******** used as a *********** of some kind.  It had, in its day, ******** ********* ********** to the *********** of the *********** *********.  But it had long since gone to ****.  The ***, the ****, and the action of the ****, had ******** and ****** the ***** on which it stood; and a ************ ******* of the ******** had already **** down into the water; while the *********, ********* and ******* over the dark ******, seemed to **** a ********** opportunity of following its old companion, and ********* itself in the same ****. 

It was before this ******* ******** that the worthy couple paused, as the first **** of ******* ******* ************ in the air, and the rain ********* ******* ********* down. 

'The place should be ********* here,' said Bumble, ********** a ***** of paper he held in his hand. 

'****** there!' cried a voice from above. 

Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and ******** a man looking out of a door, ******-****, on the second story. 

'Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice; 'I'll be with you directly.' With which the head ***********, and the door closed. 

'Is that the man?' asked Mr. Bumble's good lady. 

Mr. Bumble nodded in the ***********. 

'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be ******* to say as little as you can, or you'll ****** us at once.' 

Mr. Bumble, who had **** the ******** with very ****** looks, was apparently about to ******* some ****** ******** to the ************ of ********** any further with the ********** just then, when he was ********* by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and ******** them *******. 

'Come in!' he cried impatiently, ******** his foot upon the ground. 'Don't keep me here!' 

The woman, who had ********* at first, walked ****** in, without any other **********.  Mr. Bumble, who was ******* or afraid to *** behind, followed:  ********* very ill at **** and with scarcely any of that ********** ******* which was ******* his ***** **************. 

'What the devil made you stand ********* there, in the ***?' said Monks, turning round, and ********** Bumble, after he had ****** the door behind them. 

'**--** were only ******* *********,' ********* Bumble, looking ************** about him. 

'******* **********!' retorted Monks.  'Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will ****, will put as much of ****'* fire out, as a man can carry about with him.  You won't **** yourself so ******; don't think it!' 

With this ********* ******, Monks turned short upon the matron, and **** his **** upon her, till even she, who was not ****** *****, was **** to ******** her eyes, and turn them towards the ground. 

'This is the woman, is it?' demanded Monks. 

'***!  That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, ******* of his ****'* 



'You think women never can keep *******, I suppose?' said the matron, ***********, and *********, as she spoke, the ********* look of Monks. 

'I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,' said Monks. 

'And what may that be?' asked the matron. 

'The loss of their own good name,' replied Monks.  'So, by the same ****, if a *****'* a party to a secret that might **** or ********* her, I'm not afraid of her ******* it to anybody; not I!  Do you understand, ********?' 

'No,' rejoined the matron, ******** ********* as she spoke. 

'Of course you don't!' said Monks.  'How should you?' 

********* something ****-*** between a smile and a ***** upon his two companions, and again ********* them to follow him, the man ******** across the *********, which was of ************ ******, but low in the ****.  He was ********* to ****** a ***** *********, or rather ******, ******* to another floor of ********** above:  when a bright ***** of ********* ******** down the ********, and a **** of ******* followed, which shook the ***** ******** to its ******. 

'Hear it!' he cried, ********* back.  'Hear it!  ******* and ******** on as if it ****** through a ******** ******* where the ****** were ****** from it.  I **** the sound!' 

He remained silent for a few moments; and then, ******** his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the *********** ************ of Mr. Bumble, that it was much ********* and ***********. 

'These **** come over me, now and then,' said Monks, ********* his alarm; 'and ******* sometimes ****** them on. Don't mind me now; it's all over for this once.' 

Thus speaking, he led the way up the ******; and hastily ******* the ******-******* of the room into which it led, ******* a lantern which hung at the end of a **** and ****** passed through one of the heavy ***** in the *******:  and which cast a *** light upon an old table and three ****** that were placed beneath it. 

'Now,' said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, 'the sooner we come to our business, the better for all.  The woman know what it is, does she?' 

The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife *********** the reply, by ********** that she was perfectly ********** with it. 

'He is right in saying that you were with this *** the night she died; and that she told you something--' 

'About the mother of the boy you *****,' replied the matron ************ him.  'Yes.' 

'The first question is, of what nature was her *************?' said 



'That's the second,' observed the woman with much ************. 'The first is, what may the ************* be worth?' 

'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?' asked Monks. 

'Nobody better than you, I am *********,' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for ******, as her ****-****** could ********** *******. 

'*****!' said Monks *************, and with a look of ***** inquiry; 'there may be *****'* worth to get, eh?' 

'Perhaps there may,' was the ******** reply. 

'Something that was taken from her,' said Monks.  'Something that she ****.  Something that--' 

'You had better ***,' *********** Mrs. Bumble.  'I have heard enough, already, to ****** me that you are the man I ought to talk to.' 

Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been ******** by his better half into any ******* ***** of the secret than he had ********** *********, listened to this ******** with ************ neck and ********* eyes:  which he ******** towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in *********** astonishment; *********, if possible, when the latter ******* demanded, what *** was ******** for the **********. 

'What's it worth to you?' asked the woman, as *********** as before. 

'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,' replied Monks. 'Speak out, and let me know which.' 

'*** five pounds to the *** you have *****; give me ****-***-****** pounds in gold,' said the woman; 'and I'll tell you all I know.  Not 



'****-***-****** pounds!' exclaimed Monks, drawing back. 

'I spoke as ******* as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble.  'It's not a large ***, either.' 

'Not a large *** for a ****** secret, that may be nothing when it's told!' cried Monks impatiently; 'and which has been lying dead for ****** years past or more!' 

'Such matters keep well, and, like good ****, often ****** their ***** in course of time,' answered the matron, still ********** the ******** ************ she had *******.  'As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for ****** ******** years to come, or ****** *******, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange ***** at last!' 

'What if I pay it for nothing?' asked Monks, **********. 

'You can ****** take it away again,' replied the matron. 'I am but a woman; alone here; and ***********.' 

'Not alone, my dear, nor ***********, neither,' ********* Mr. Bumble, in a voice ********* with fear: '_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,' said Mr. Bumble, his teeth ********** as he spoke, 'Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to ******* any violence on porochial *******.  Mr. Monks is ***** that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to ****, as I may say; ** he has *****:  I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has *****, my dear:  that I am a very determined officer, with very ******** strength, if I'm once roused.  I only want a little *******; that's all.' 

As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a ********** ***** of ******** his lantern with ****** *************; and ******* showed, by the ******* expression of every *******, that he _did_ want a little *******, and not a little, ***** to making any very ******* *************: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or ******* ******* down for the purpose. 

'You are a ****,' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; 'and had better hold your 



'He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can't speak in a lower tone,' said Monks, ******.  'So!  He's your *******, eh?' 

'He my *******!' ******** the matron, ******** the question. 

'I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined Monks, ******* the ***** glance which the lady ****** at her ****** as she spoke.  'So much the better; I have less ********** in ******* with two people, when I find that there's only one will between them.  I'm in earnest. See here!' 

He thrust his hand into a ****-******; and ********* a ****** ***, told out ******-**** ********** on the table, and ****** them over to the 



'Now,' he said, '****** them up; and when this ****** **** of *******, which I feel is coming up to ***** over the *****-***, is gone, ***'* hear your story.' 

The *******, which seemed in fact much ******, and to ****** and ***** almost over their heads, having ********, Monks, raising his face from the table, **** forward to listen to what the woman should say.  The faces of the three nearly *******, as the two men ***** over the small table in their ********* to hear, and the woman also ***** forward to ****** her whisper *******.  The ****** **** of the ********* lantern falling directly upon them, ********** the ******** and ******* of their ************: which, ********* by the ******* ***** and darkness, looked ******* in the *******. 

'When this woman, that we called old *****, died,' the matron began, 'she and I were alone.' 

'Was there no one by?' asked Monks, in the same ****** whisper; 'No sick ****** or ***** in some other bed?  No one who could hear, and might, by ***********, understand?' 

'Not a soul,' replied the woman; 'we were alone.  _I_ stood alone ****** the body when death came over it.' 

'Good,' said Monks, ********* her ***********.  'Go on.' 

'She spoke of a young creature,' resumed the matron, 'who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay *****.' 

'**?' said Monks, with ********* ***, and glancing over his shoulder, 'Blood!  How things come about!' 

'The child was the one you ***** to him last night,' said the matron, ******* ********** towards her *******; 'the mother this ***** had 



'In life?' asked Monks. 

'In death,' replied the woman, with something like a *******. 'She ***** from the ******, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had ****** her, with her last breath, to keep for the ******'* sake.' 

'She **** it,' cried Monks, with desperate *********; 'did she **** it? Where?  When?  To whom?  How long before?' 

'As she told me, with great **********, that she had done this,' said the matron, 'she fell back and died.' 

'Without saying more?' cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very ***********, seemed only the more *******.  'It's a lie! I'll not be ****** with.  She said more.  I'll **** the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was.' 

'She didn't ***** another word,' said the woman, to all appearance ******* (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's violence; 'but she ******** my ****, *********, with one hand, which was ****** closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so ******* the hand by force, I found it ******* a ***** of dirty paper.' 

'Which *********--' interposed Monks, ********** forward. 

'Nothing,' replied the woman; 'it was a **********'* *********.' 

'For what?' demanded Monks. 

'In good time I'll tell you.' said the woman.  'I ***** that she had kept the *******, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had ****** it; and had ***** or ******* together money to pay the **********'* interest year by year, and ******* its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be ********.  Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the ***** of paper, all **** and ********, in her hand.  The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so ******** the ******.' 

'Where is it now?' asked Monks quickly. 

'_There_,' replied the woman.  And, as if glad to be ******** of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small *** *** scarcely large enough for a ****** watch, which Monks ******** upon, **** open with trembling hands.  It ********* a little gold ******: in which were two ***** of hair, and a ***** gold *******-****. 

'It has the word "*****" ******** on the inside,' said the woman. 

'There is a ***** left for the *******; and then ******* the ****; which is within a year before the child was born.  I found out that.' 

'And this is all?' said Monks, after a close and ***** ******** of the ******** of the little ******. 

'All,' replied the woman. 

Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no ******* made of taking the ****-***-****** pounds back again; and now he took ******* to **** the ************ which had been ********* over his nose, *********, during the whole of the previous ********. 

'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can ***** at,' said his wife ********** Monks, after a short silence; 'and I want to know nothing; for it's ***** not.  But I may ask you two *********, may I?' 

'You may ask,' said Monks, with some show of surprise; 'but whether I answer or not is another question.' 

'--Which ***** three,' observed Mr. Bumble, ******** a ****** of 



'Is that what you expected to get from me?' demanded the matron. 

'It is,' replied Monks.  'The other question?' 

'What do you ******* to do with it?  Can it be used against me?' 

'Never,' rejoined Monks; 'nor against me either.  See here!  But don't **** a step forward, or your life is not worth a *******.' 

With these words, he suddenly ******* the table *****, and ******* an iron **** in the ********, threw back a large ****-**** which opened close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and ****** that gentleman to ****** several ***** ********, with great *************. 

'Look down,' said Monks, ******** the lantern into the ****. 'Don't fear me.  I could have let you down, ******* enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.' 

Thus **********, the matron drew near to the *****; and even Mr. Bumble himself, ******** by **********, ******** to do the same. The ****** water, ******* by the heavy rain, was ******* ******* on below; and all other ****** were lost in the noise of its ******** and ******* against the green and ***** *****.  There had once been a *****-**** beneath; the **** ******* and ******* round the few ****** ******, and ********* of ********* that yet remained, seemed to **** ******, with a new *******, when ***** from the ********* which had ************ ********* to **** its ******** course. 

'If you ***** a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?' said Monks, ******** the lantern to and fro in the dark well. 

'****** miles down the *****, and cut to ****** besides,' replied Bumble, ********* at the thought. 

Monks drew the little ****** from his breast, where he had ********* thrust it; and ***** it to a ****** ******, which had ****** a part of some ******, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the ******. It fell straight, and true as a die; ***** the water with a scarcely ******* ******; and was gone. 

The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to ******* more 



'There!' said Monks, ******* the ****-****, which fell ******* back into its former position.  'If the *** ever ***** up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and ****** to itself, and that ***** among it.  We have nothing more to say, and may ***** up our pleasant 



'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great ********. 

'You'll keep a quiet ****** in your head, will you?' said Monks, with a *********** look.  'I am not afraid of your wife.' 

'You may ****** upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, ****** himself gradually towards the ******, with ********* **********. 'On *********'* account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.' 

'I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,' ******** Monks. 'Light your lantern!  And get away from here as fast as you can.' 

It was ********* that the conversation ********** at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had ***** himself to within six ****** of the ******, would ********** have ******* ******** into the room below.  He ******* his lantern from that which Monks had ******** from the ****, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to ******* the *********, ********* in silence, followed by his wife.  Monks brought up the ****, after ******* on the steps to ******* himself that there were no other ****** to be heard than the ******* of the rain without, and the ******* of the water. 

They ********* the lower room, slowly, and with *******; for Monks started at every ******; and Mr. Bumble, ******* his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with ********** care, but with a ************ light step for a gentleman of his ******:  looking ********* about him for ****** ****-*****.  The gate at which they had entered, was softly ********** and opened by Monks; merely ********** a *** with their ********** ************, the ******* couple ******* into the *** and darkness outside. 

They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to ********* an ********** ********** to being left alone, called to a boy who had been ****** ********* below. ******* him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the ******* he had just *******. 





CHAPTER ***** 

********** SOME *********** ********** WITH WHOM THE ****** IS ALREADY **********, AND ***** HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS 



On the evening following that upon which the three ******** ********* in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as ******* ********, Mr. ******* Sikes, ********* from a ***, ******** growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was. 

The room in which Mr. Sikes ********** this question, was not one of those he had ********, previous to the ******** **********, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was ******** at no great distance from his former ********.  It was not, in appearance, so ********* a ********** as his old ********:  being a mean and *****-********* *********, of very ******* ****; ******* only by one small window in the ******** ****, and ******** on a close and dirty ****.  Nor were there ******* other *********** of the good gentleman's having gone down in the world of late:  for a great ******** of *********, and ***** ******* of *******, together with the ************* of all such small ********* as ***** clothes and *****, ******* a state of ******* *******; while the ****** and ********** condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have ***** ********* these ********, if they had stood in any need of *************. 

The ************ was lying on the bed, ******* in his white *****-****, by way of ********-****, and ********** a set of features in no ****** ******** by the ********** *** of *******, and the ******** of a ****** ********, and a *****, black ***** of a ****'* ******.  The dog sat at the *******:  now ****** his master with a ******* look, and now ******** his ears, and ******** a low ***** as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, ********* his attention. Seated by the window, ****** ******* in ******** an old waistcoat which ****** a ******* of the ******'* ******** *****, was a female:  so pale and ******* with watching and *********, that there would have been ************ ********** in *********** her as the same Nancy who has already ******* in this ****, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. *****'* question. 

'Not long gone *****,' said the girl.  'How do you feel to-night, Bill?' 

'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an *********** on his eyes and *****.  'Here; **** us a hand, and let me get off this ********** bed ******.' 

******* had not ******** Mr. *****'* ******; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various ****** on her ***********, and struck her. 

'******* are you?' said Sikes.  'Come!  Don't stand ********** there. If you can't do anything better than that, cut off **********.  *'** hear me?' 

'I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face *****, and ******* a laugh.  'What ***** have you got in your head now?' 

'Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?' growled Sikes, ******* the **** which ******** in her eye.  'All the better for you, you have.' 

'Why, you don't mean to say, ***'* be hard upon me to-night, Bill,' said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder. 

'No!' cried Mr. Sikes.  'Why not?' 

'Such a number of ******,' said the girl, with a ***** of *****'* **********, which ************ something like ********* of tone, even to her voice: 'such a number of ****** as I've been ******* with you, ******* and ****** for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have ****** me as you did just now, if ***'* thought of that, would you?  Come, come; say you wouldn't.' 

'Well, then,' rejoined Mr. Sikes, 'I wouldn't.  Why, *****, now, the *****'* ******* again!' 

'It's nothing,' said the girl, ******** herself into a chair. 'Don't you **** to mind me.  **'** soon be over.' 

'****'** be over?' demanded Mr. Sikes in a ****** voice. 'What ******* are you up to, now, again?  Get up and ****** about, and don't come over me with your *****'* ********.' 

At any other time, this ************, and the tone in which it was *********, would have had the ******* effect; but the girl being really weak and *********, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and *******, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the *********** ***** with which, on ******* *********, he was ********** to ******* his *******.  Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this ******** *********; for Miss *****'* ********* were ******* of that violent kind which the ******* ****** and ********* out of, without much **********; Mr. Sikes tried a little *********: and finding that **** of ********* ****** ***********, called for **********. 

'What's the matter here, my dear?' said Fagin, looking in. 

'**** a hand to the girl, can't you?' replied Sikes impatiently. 'Don't stand ********** and ******** at me!' 

With an *********** of surprise, Fagin ******** to the ****'* **********, while Mr. **** Dawkins (********* the Artful Dodger), who had followed his ********* friend into the room, hastily ********* on the floor a ****** with which he was *****; and ********* a ****** from the ***** of Master ******* Bates who came close at his *****, ******** it in a ********* with his teeth, and ****** a ******* of its ******** down the *******'* throat:  ********** taking a *****, himself, to ******* ********. 

'Give her a ***** of fresh air with the *******, Charley,' said Mr. Dawkins; 'and you **** her hands, Fagin, while Bill ****** the 



These ****** ************, ************ with great ******: ********** that ********** ********* to Master Bates, who appeared to ******** his ***** in the ***********, a piece of ********** **********:  were not long in ********* the ******* effect.  The girl gradually ********* her ******; and, ********** to a chair by the *******, *** her face upon the ******:  leaving Mr. Sikes to ******** the new ******, in some astonishment at their ********-*** appearance. 

'Why, what **** wind has ****** you here?' he asked Fagin. 

'No **** wind at all, my dear, for **** ***** blow nobody any good; and I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see. Dodger, my dear, open the ******; and give Bill the little ******* that we ***** all our money on, this morning.' 

In ********** with Mr. *****'* *******, the Artful ****** this ******, which was of large ****, and ****** of an old *****-*****; and ****** the ******** it *********, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various ********* on their ****** and 



'***** a ****** ***, Bill,' exclaimed that young gentleman, ********** to view a **** *****; '***** ******** ********, with ***** ****** *****, Bill, that the **** ***** **** in your mouth, and there's no occasion to **** 'em; half a pound of ***** and ***-***** green, so ******** strong that if you *** it with ****** water, **'** go **** to blow the *** of the ***-*** off; a pound and a half of ***** ***** that the ******* didn't work at all at, afore they got it up to ***** a ***** of ********,--** no!  Two ****-******** *****; pound of best fresh; piece of ****** ***'****; and, to wind up all, some of the ******* sort you ever ******!' 

******** this last *********, Master Bates ********, from one of his ********* pockets, a ****-***** ****-******, carefully ******; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, ****** out a ****-******** of *** spirits from the ****** he carried:  which the ******* ****** down his throat without a moment's **********. 

'Ah!' said Fagin, ******* his hands with great satisfaction. 'You'll do, Bill; you'll do now.' 

'Do!' exclaimed Mr. Sikes; 'I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore ***'* have done anything to help me.  What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three ***** and more, you *****-******* 



'Only hear him, boys!' said Fagin, ********* his shoulders. 'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.' 

'The things is well enough in their way,' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little ******* as he ******* over the table; 'but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, ******, *****, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this ****** time, than if I was that '*** ***.--***** him down, Charley!' 

'I never see such a ***** dog as that,' cried Master Bates, doing as he was *******.  '******** the **** like a old lady a going to ******! He'd make his ******' on the ***** that dog would, and ****** the ****** besides.' 

'Hold your ***,' cried Sikes, as the dog ********* under the bed: still ******** *******.  'What have you got to say for yourself, you ******** old *****, eh?' 

'I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a *****,' replied the Jew. 

'And what about the other *********?' demanded Sikes.  'What about the other ********* that you've left me lying here, like a sick *** in his 



'I couldn't help it, Bill.  I can't go into a long *********** before company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.' 

'Upon your what?' growled Sikes, with ********* *******. 'Here! Cut me off a piece of that ***, one of you boys, to take the ***** of that out of my mouth, or **'** ***** me dead.' 

'Don't be out of ******, my dear,' ***** Fagin, ************. 'I have never ****** you, Bill; never once.' 

'No!  I'll pound it that you ***'*,' replied Sikes, with a ****** grin. 'You've been ******** and ******** away, every hour that I have laid ********* and ******* here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, **** *****, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it ****'* been for the girl, I might have died.' 

'There now, Bill,' ************ Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. 'If it ****'* been for the girl!  Who but poor **** Fagin was the means of your having such a ***** girl about you?' 

'He says true enough there!' said Nancy, coming hastily forward. 'Let him be; let him be.' 

*****'* appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, ********* a *** **** from the **** old Jew, began to *** her with ******: of which, however, she took very *********; while Fagin, ******** an ******* **** of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better ******, by ********* to ****** his ******* as a little pleasant ******; and, ********, by ******** very ******** at one or two ***** *****, which, after repeated ************ to the ******-******, he ************ to make. 

'It's all very well,' said Mr. Sikes; 'but I must have some ***** from you to-night.' 

'I haven't a piece of **** about me,' replied the Jew. 

'Then you've got **** at home,' retorted Sikes; 'and I must have some from there.' 

'****!' cried Fagin, ******* up is hands.  'I haven't so much as 



'I don't know how much you've got, and I **** say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to ***** it,' said Sikes; 'but I must have some to-night; and that's ****.' 

'Well, well,' said Fagin, with a ****, 'I'll send the Artful round 



'You won't do nothing of the kind,' rejoined Mr. Sikes. 'The ******'* a deal too artful, and would ****** to come, or lose his way, or get ****** by ***** and so be *********, or anything for an ******, if you put him up to it.  Nancy shall go to the *** and ***** it, to make all sure; and I'll lie down and have a ****** while she's gone.' 

After a great deal of ******** and **********, Fagin beat down the ****** of the ******** ******* from five pounds to three pounds four and ********: ********** with many ****** ************* that that would only leave him ********-***** to keep house with; Mr. Sikes ******** ********* that if he couldn't get any more he must ********* him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the ******** in the ********.  The Jew then, taking leave of his ************ friend, returned ********, ******** by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, ******** himself on the bed, and ********* himself to sleep away the time until the young ****'* return. 

In *** course, they arrived at *****'* *****, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling ****** upon their ********* game at ********, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his ********* and last ********: much to the ********* of his young friends.  Mr. Crackit, apparently ******** ******* at being found ******** himself with a gentleman so much his ******** in ******* and ****** **********, ******, and ********* after Sikes, took up his hat to go. 

'Has nobody been, Toby?' asked Fagin. 

'Not a living ***,' answered Mr. Crackit, ******* up his ******; 'it's been as **** as ******.  You ought to stand something ********, Fagin, to ********** me for ******* house so long. *****, I'm as **** as a *******; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as *******, if I ****'* had the good *****' to ***** this *********.  ****** ****, I'm ******* if I **'*!' 

With these and other ************ of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit ***** up his ********, and ******* them into his waistcoat pocket with a ******* air, as though such small ****** of ****** were ****** beneath the consideration of a man of his ******; this done, he ********* out of the room, with so much ******** and *********, that Mr. Chitling, ********* ******** ******** ******* on his legs and ***** till they were out of sight, ******* the company that he considered his ************ ***** at ******* ********* an *********, and that he didn't ***** his ****** the **** of his little ******. 

'Wot a *** **** you are, Tom!' said Master Bates, ****** ****** by this 



'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Chitling.  'Am I, Fagin?' 

'A very ****** fellow, my dear,' said Fagin, ******* him on the shoulder, and ******* to his other ******. 

'And Mr. Crackit is a heavy *****; **'* he, Fagin?' asked Tom. 

'No doubt at all of that, my dear.' 

'And it is a ********** thing to have his ************; **'* it, Fagin?' pursued Tom. 

'Very much so, indeed, my dear.  They're only *******, Tom, because he won't give it to them.' 

'Ah!' cried Tom, ************, 'that's where it is!  He has ******* me out.  But I can go and **** some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?' 

'To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don't lose any more time.  Dodger! Charley! It's time you were on the lay.  Come!  It's near ten, and nothing done 



In ********* to this ****, the boys, ******* to Nancy, took up their ****, and left the room; the Dodger and his ********* friend *********, as they went, in many ********** at the ******* of Mr. Chitling; in whose *******, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very *********** or ********:  ******** as there are a great number of ******** young ****** upon town, who pay a much ****** ***** than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine gentlemen (********* the good society *********) who *********** their ********** upon very much the same ******* as ***** Toby Crackit. 

'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you that ****, Nancy.  This is only the key of a little ******** where I keep a few *** things the boys get, my dear.  I never **** up my money, for I've got none to **** up, my ****--**! ha! **!--**** to **** up. It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no ******; but I'm **** of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.  Hush!' he said, hastily ********** the key in his breast; '***'* that?  Listen!' 

The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms ******, appeared in no way ********** in the *******: or to care whether the person, ******* he was, came or went:  until the ****** of a man's voice reached her ears.  The instant she caught the sound, she **** off her ****** and *****, with the ******** of *********, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a ********* of the ****:  in a tone of ******* that **********, very **********, with the ******* ***** and violence of this action:  which, however, had been ********** by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time. 

'***!' he whispered, as though ******* by the ************; 'it's the man I expected before; he's coming downstairs.  Not a word about the money while he's here, *****.  He won't stop long.  Not ten minutes, my 



Laying his ****** ********** upon his ***, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.  He reached it, at the same moment as the *******, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her. 

It was Monks. 

'Only one of my young people,' said Fagin, ********* that Monks drew back, on ********* a stranger.  'Don't ****, Nancy.' 

The girl drew ****** to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of ******** ******, ******** her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she ***** another look; so **** and *********, and full of purpose, that if there had been any ********* to ******* the change, he could hardly have ******** the two looks to have proceeded from the same person. 

'Any ****?' inquired Fagin. 





'***--***--****?' asked Fagin, ********** as though he ****** to *** the other man by being too ********. 

'Not bad, any way,' replied Monks with a smile.  'I have been ****** enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.' 

The girl drew ****** to the table, and made no ***** to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.  The Jew: perhaps ******* she might say something ***** about the money, if he *********** to get *** of her:  pointed ******, and took Monks out of the room. 

'Not that ******** **** we were in before,' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not ***** her, seemed, by the ******** of the ******, to **** his companion to the second story. 

Before the sound of their ********* had ****** to **** through the house, the girl had ******* off her *****; and drawing her **** ******* over her head, and ******** her arms in it, stood at the door, ********* with ********** interest.  The moment the noise ******, she ****** from the room; ******** the stairs with ********** ******** and silence; and was lost in the ***** above. 

The room remained ******** for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl ****** back with the same ********* *****; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard **********.  Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew ******* upstairs again for the money.  When he returned, the girl was ********* her ***** and ******, as if ********* to be gone. 

'Why, *****!' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, 'how pale you are!' 

'Pale!' ****** the girl, ******* her eyes with her hands, as if to look ******** at him. 

'Quite ********.  What have you been doing to yourself?' 

'Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't know how long and all,' replied the girl **********. 'Come!  Let me get back; that's a dear.' 

With a **** for every piece of money, Fagin told the ****** into her hand.  They ****** without more conversation, merely ************* a 



When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a ********; and seemed, for a few moments, ****** ********** and ****** to ****** her way.  Suddenly she *****; and ******** on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was ******** her returned, ********* her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.  After ********** ********** herself, she stopped to take breath:  and, as if suddenly ************ herself, and ********* her ********* to do something she was **** upon, ***** her hands, and burst into tears. 

It might be that her tears ******** her, or that she felt the full ************ of her condition; but she turned back; and ******** with nearly as great ******** in the ******** direction; ****** to ******* lost time, and ****** to keep pace with the violent ******* of her own thoughts:  soon reached the ******** where she had left the 



If she ******** any *********, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not ******* it; for merely ********* if she had brought the money, and ********* a reply in the ***********, he uttered a ***** of satisfaction, and ********* his head upon the ******, resumed the ******** which her ******* had ***********. 

It was ********* for her that the ********** of money ********** him so much ********** next day in the way of ****** and ********; and ****** had so ********** an effect in ********* down the ********** of his ******; that he had neither time nor *********** to be very ******** upon her ********* and **********.  That she had all the ********** and ******* manner of one who is on the *** of some **** and ********* step, which it has ******** no common ******** to ******* upon, would have been ******* to the ****-**** Fagin, who would most ******** have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes ******* the ******** of **************, and being ******** with no more ****** ********** than those which ******* themselves into a ****** ********* of ********* towards *********; and being, ***********, in an ********* ******* condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing ******* in her ********, and indeed, ******** himself so little about her, that, had her ********* been far more *********** than it was, it would have been very ******** to have awakened his **********. 

As that day closed in, the ****'* ********** *********; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the ************ should drink himself ******, there was an ******* ******** in her *****, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment. 

Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking *** water with his *** to ****** it less ************; and had ****** his glass towards Nancy to be *********** for the ***** or ****** time, when these ******** first struck him. 

'Why, **** my body!' said the man, raising himself on his hands as he ****** the girl in the face.  'You look like a ****** come to life again.  What's the matter?' 

'Matter!' replied the girl.  'Nothing.  What do you look at me so hard 



'What ******* is this?' demanded Sikes, ******** her by the arm, and shaking her *******.  'What is it?  What do you mean?  What are you thinking of?' 

'Of many things, Bill,' replied the girl, *********, and as she did so, ******** her hands upon her eyes.  'But, ****!  What **** in that?' 

The tone of forced ****** in which the last words were spoken, seemed to ******* a ****** ********** on Sikes than the **** and ***** look which had ******** them. 

'I tell you wot it is,' said Sikes; 'if you haven't caught the fever, and got it *****' on, now, there's something more than usual in the wind, and something ********* too.  You're not *-***** to--.  No, *****! you wouldn't do that!' 

'Do what?' asked the girl. 

'There ain't,' said Sikes, ****** his eyes upon her, and ********* the words to himself; 'there ain't a *********-******* *** going, or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.  She's got the fever coming on; that's it.' 

********** himself with this *********, Sikes ******* the glass to the ******, and then, with many ********* *****, called for his ******. The girl ****** up, with great ********; ****** it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the ****** to his lips, while he ***** off the ********. 

'Now,' said the robber, 'come and sit ***** of me, and put on your own face; or I'll ***** it so, that you won't know it **** when you do want 



The girl ******.  Sikes, ******* her hand in his, fell back upon the ******: turning his eyes upon her face.  They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened.  He ******* his position **********; and, after ****** again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often ********* up with a look of ******, and ****** ******** about him, was suddenly ********, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.  The ***** of his hand *******; the ******** arm fell ********* by his side; and he lay like one in a ******** ******. 

'The ******** has taken effect at last,' ******** the girl, as she rose from the *******.  'I may be too late, even now.' 

She hastily ******* herself in her ****** and *****:  looking ********* round, from time to time, as if, ******* the ******** *******, she expected every moment to feel the ******** of *****'* heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, ******** softly over the bed, she ****** the ******'* lips; and then opening and ******* the ****-**** with ********* *****, hurried from the house. 

A ******** was ****** ****-**** ****, down a dark passage through which she had to ****, in ******* the **** ************. 

'Has it long gone the ****-****?' asked the girl. 

'**'** ****** the hour in another quarter,' said the man: raising his lantern to her face. 

'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered Nancy: ******** ******* past him, and ******* ******* down the street. 

Many of the ***** were already ******* in the back ***** and ******* through which she ******* her way, in making from ************ towards the ****-*** of London.  The ***** struck ten, ********** her **********.  She **** along the narrow ********:  ******** the ********** from side to side; and ******* almost under the ******' heads, crossed crowded streets, where ******** of ******* were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like. 

'The woman is mad!' said the people, turning to look after her as she ****** away. 

When she reached the more ******* quarter of the town, the streets were ************* ********; and here her ******** ******** ******* a still ******* ********* in the ********** whom she hurried past.  Some ********* their pace behind, as though to see ******* she was ********* at such an ******* ****; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, ********* at her ************ *****; but they fell off one by one; and when she ****** her place of ***********, she was alone. 

It was a family ***** in a quiet but ******** street near **** ****. As the ********* light of the **** which ***** before its door, ****** her to the spot, the ***** struck ******.  She had ******** for a few ***** as though **********, and making up her mind to *******; but the sound determined her, and she ******* into the ****.  The ******'* seat was ******.  She looked round with an air of ***********, and ******** towards the stairs. 

'Now, young woman!' said a *******-******* female, looking out from a door behind her, 'who do you want here?' 

'A lady who is stopping in this house,' answered the girl. 

'A lady!' was the reply, accompanied with a ******** look. 'What lady?' 

'Miss Maylie,' said Nancy. 

The young woman, who had by this time, ***** her appearance, replied only by a look of ******** *******; and ******** a man to answer her. To him, Nancy repeated her *******. 

'What name am I to say?' asked the ******. 

'It's of no use saying any,' replied Nancy. 

'Nor business?' said the man. 

'No, nor that neither,' rejoined the girl.  'I must see the lady.' 

'Come!' said the man, ******* her towards the door.  'None of this. Take yourself off.' 

'I shall be carried out if I go!' said the girl *********; 'and I can make that a *** that two of you won't like to do.  Isn't there anybody here,' she said, looking round, 'that will see a ****** ******* carried for a poor ****** like me?' 

This ****** ******** an effect on a ****-********-***** ***-****, who with some of the other ******** was looking on, and who ******* forward to *********. 

'Take it up for her, ***; can't you?' said this person. 

'What's the good?' replied the man.  'You don't suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?' 

This ******** to *****'* ******** *********, raised a **** ******** of ****** ***** in the ****** of four **********, who ********, with great *******, that the creature was a ******** to her ***; and ******** ********* her being ******, **********, into the ******. 

'Do what you like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again; 'but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this ******* for God ********'* sake.' 

The ****-******* **** added his ************, and the ****** was that the man who had first appeared ********* its ********. 

'What's it to be?' said the man, with one foot on the stairs. 

'That a young woman ********* **** to speak to Miss Maylie alone,' said Nancy; 'and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of ***** as an ********.' 

'I say,' said the man, 'you're coming it strong!' 

'You give the *******,' said the girl firmly; 'and let me hear the 



The man ran upstairs.  Nancy remained, pale and almost **********, ********* with ********* *** to the very ******* *********** of *****, of which the ****** ********** were very ********; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs. 

'It's no good being ****** in this world,' said the first *********. 

'***** can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,' said the 



The ***** ********* herself with ********* 'what ladies was made of'; and the ****** took the first in a ********* of '********!' with which the ****** *********. 

********** of all this: for she had ********* matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling *****, to a small ****-*******, ******* by a **** from the *******. Here he left her, and *******. 





CHAPTER ** 

A STRANGE *********, WHICH IS A ****** TO THE LAST ******* 

The ****'* life had been ********** in the streets, and among the most ******* of the ***** and **** of London, but there was something of the *****'* ******** nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step *********** the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the **** ******** which the small room would in another moment *******, she felt ******** with the sense of her own deep *****, and ****** as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had ****** this *********. 

But ********** with these better feelings was *****,--*** **** of the ****** and most ******* ********* no less than of the high and ****-*******.  The ********* companion of ******* and ********, the ****** ******* of low ******, the ********* of the ********* of the ***** and *****, living within the ****** of the ******* ******,--**** this ******** being felt too ***** to ****** a ****** ***** of the ******* feeling which she thought a ********, but which alone ********* her with that ********, of which her ******* life had *********** so many, many ****** when a very child. 

She raised her eyes ************ to ******* that the ****** which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, ******* them on the ground, she ****** her head with ******** ************ as she said: 

'It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.  If I had taken *******, and gone away, as many would have done, ***'* have been ***** for it one day, and not without reason either.' 

'I am very ***** if any one has ******* ******* to you,' replied Rose. 'Do not think of that.  Tell me why you ****** to see me. I am the person you inquired for.' 

The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the ******* of any ****** of *********** or ***********, took the girl ********** by surprise, and she burst into tears. 

'Oh, lady, lady!' she said, ******** her hands ************ before her face, 'if there was more like you, there would be ***** like **,--***** *****--***** would!' 

'Sit down,' said Rose, *********.  'If you are in ******* or ********** I shall be ***** glad to ******* you if I ***,--* shall indeed.  Sit 



'Let me stand, lady,' said the girl, still *******, 'and do not speak to me so ****** till you know me better.  It is ******* late. **--**--**** door shut?' 

'Yes,' said Rose, ********* a few steps, as if to be ****** ********** in case she should ******* it.  'Why?' 

'Because,' said the girl, 'I am about to put my life and the ***** of others in your hands.  I am the girl that ******* little Oliver back to old *****'* on the night he went out from the house in ***********.' 

'You!' said Rose Maylie. 

'I, lady!' replied the girl.  'I am the ******** creature you have heard of, that ***** among the *******, and that never from the first moment I can ********* my eyes and ****** opening on London streets have known any better life, or ****** words than they have given me, so help me God!  Do not mind ********* ****** from me, lady.  I am ******* than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The ******* women **** back, as I make my way along the crowded ********.' 

'What dreadful things are these!' said Rose, ************* falling from her strange companion. 

'Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,' cried the girl, 'that you had friends to care for and keep you in your *********, and that you were never in the ***** of cold and ******, and **** and ***********, ***--***--********* worse than ***--** I have been from my ******.  I may use the word, for the ***** and the ****** were mine, as they will be my ********.' 

'I pity you!' said Rose, in a broken voice.  'It ****** my heart to hear you!' 

'Heaven bless you for your goodness!' rejoined the girl. 'If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have ****** away from those who would ****** murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have *********.  Do you know a man ***** Monks?' 

'No,' said Rose. 

'He knows you,' replied the girl; 'and knew you were here, for it was by ******* him tell the place that I found you out.' 

'I never heard the name,' said Rose. 

'Then he **** by some other ******* us,' rejoined the girl, 'which I more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, *--********** this ***--******** to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that *****--*** man I asked you about, you know--' 

'Yes,' said Rose, 'I understand.' 

'--That Monks,' pursued the girl, 'had seen him ********** with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn't make out why.  A ******* was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain ***; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.' 

'For what purpose?' asked Rose. 

'He caught sight of my ****** on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to ****** *********.  But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.' 

'And what ******** then?' 

'I'll tell you, lady.  Last night he came again.  Again they went upstairs, and I, ******** myself up so that my ****** would not ****** me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard Monks say were these:  "So the only ****** of the boy's ******** lie at the ****** of the *****, and the old *** that received them from the mother is ******* in her coffin."  They laughed, and ****** of his ******* in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and ******* very ****, said that though he had got the young *****'* money ****** now, he'd rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the ***** of the ******'* will, by ******* him through every **** in town, and then ******* him up for some ******* ****** which Fagin could ****** ******, after having made a good ****** of him besides.' 

'What is all this!' said Rose. 

'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,' replied the girl. 'Then, he said, with ***** common enough in my ears, but strange to *****, that if he could ******* his ****** by taking the boy's life without ******** his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn't, he'd be upon the watch to **** him at every turn in life; and if he took ********* of his birth and history, he might **** him yet. "In short, Fagin," he says, "Jew as you are, you never laid such ****** as I'll ******** for my young *******, Oliver."' 

'His *******!' exclaimed Rose. 

'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing ******** round, as she had scarcely ****** to do, since she began to speak, for a ****** of Sikes ******* her ***********.  'And more. When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed ********* by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some ******* in that too, for how many ********* and ******** of ********* of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your ***-****** ******* was.' 

'You do not mean,' said Rose, turning very pale, 'to tell me that this was said in earnest?' 

'He spoke in hard and ***** earnest, if a man ever did,' replied the girl, shaking her head.  'He is an earnest man when his ****** is up. I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a ***** times, than to that Monks once.  It is ******* late, and I have to ***** home without ********* of having been on such an ****** as this.  I must get back quickly.' 

'But what can I do?' said Rose.  'To what use can I turn this ************* without you?  Back!  Why do you wish to return to companions you ***** in such ******** ******?  If you ****** this *********** to a gentleman whom I can ****** in an instant from the next room, you can be ********* to some place of ****** without half an hour's *****.' 

'I wish to go back,' said the girl.  'I must go back, *******--*** can I tell such things to an ******** lady like ***?--******* among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can't leave:  no, not even to be ***** from the life I am ******* now.' 

'Your having ********** in this dear boy's ****** before,' said Rose; 'your coming here, at so great a ****, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which ********* me of the truth of what you say; your ******* **********, and sense of *****; all **** me to believe that you might yet be *********.  Oh!' said the earnest girl, ******* her hands as the tears ******* down her face, 'do not turn a **** ear to the ********** of one of your own ***; the *****--*** first, I do believe, who ever ******** to you in the voice of pity and **********.  Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.' 

'Lady,' cried the girl, ******* on her knees, 'dear, sweet, ***** lady, you _are_ the first that ever ******* me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of *** and ******; but it is too late, it is too late!' 

'It is never too late,' said Rose, 'for ********* and *********.' 

'It is,' cried the girl, ******** in ***** of her mind; 'I cannot leave him now!  I could not be his death.' 

'Why should you be?' asked Rose. 

'Nothing could save him,' cried the girl.  'If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the *******, and has been so *****!' 

'Is it possible,' cried Rose, 'that for such a man as this, you can ****** every ****** hope, and the ********* of ********* ******?  It is 



'I don't know what it is,' answered the girl; 'I only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with ******** of others as bad and wretched as myself.  I must go back.  Whether it is ***'* ***** for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every ********* and ill *****; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.' 

'What am I to do?' said Rose.  'I should not let you ****** from me 



'You should, lady, and I know you will,' rejoined the girl, rising. 'You will not stop my going because I have ******* in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.' 

'Of what use, then, is the ************* you have made?' said Rose. 'This ******* must be ************, or how will its ********** to me, ******* Oliver, whom you are anxious to *****?' 

'You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and ****** you what to do,' rejoined the girl. 

'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?' asked Rose.  'I do not **** to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any ******* ****** from this time?' 

'Will you promise me that you will have my secret ******** kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?' asked the girl. 

'I promise you ********,' answered Rose. 

'Every ****** night, from ****** until the ***** ******* ******,' said the girl without **********, 'I will walk on London Bridge if I am 



'**** another moment,' interposed Rose, as the girl moved ********* towards the door.  'Think once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of ******** from it.  You have a ***** on me:  not only as the ********* ****** of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond **********.  Will you return to this **** of *******, and to this man, when a word can save you?  What *********** is it that can take you back, and make you ***** to ********** and misery?  Oh! is there no ***** in your heart that I can *****!  Is there nothing left, to which I can ****** against this ******** ***********!' 

'When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,' replied the girl ********, 'give away your ******, love will carry you all *******--**** such as you, who have home, friends, other ********, everything, to **** them.  When such as I, who have no certain **** but the *********, and no friend in ******** or death but the ******** *****, set our ****** ****** on any man, and let him **** the place that has been a ***** through all our wretched *****, who can hope to **** us?  Pity us, ****--**** us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy ********, from a ******* and a *****, into a new means of violence and *********.' 

'You will,' said Rose, after a *****, 'take some money from me, which may ****** you to live without **********--** all ****** until we **** 



'Not a *****,' replied the girl, ****** her hand. 

'Do not close your heart against all my ******* to help you,' said Rose, ******** gently forward.  'I wish to ***** you indeed.' 

'You would ***** me best, lady,' replied the girl, ******** her hands, 'if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more ***** to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have *****.  God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought ***** on mine!' 

Thus speaking, and ******* *****, the ******* creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, *********** by this ************* *********, which had more the ********* of a ***** ***** than an ****** **********, **** into a chair, and *********** to ******* her ********* thoughts. 





CHAPTER *** 

********** FRESH ***********, AND ******* THAT ********, LIKE ***********, ****** COME ALONE 

Her ********* was, indeed, one of no common ***** and **********. While she felt the most ***** and ******* ****** to ********* the ******* in which Oliver's history was *********, she could not but hold ****** the ********** which the ********* woman with whom she had just *********, had ******* in her, as a young and ********* girl.  Her words and manner had ******* Rose ******'* heart; and, ******* with her love for her young ******, and scarcely less ******* in its truth and *******, was her **** wish to *** the ******* back to ********** and hope. 

They ******** ********* in London only three days, ***** to ********* for some ***** to a ******* part of the *****.  It was now ******** of the first day.  What course of action could she ********* upon, which could be ******* in *****-***-***** hours? Or how could she ******** the ******* without ******** *********? 

Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well ********** with the ********* gentleman's ***********, and ******* too ******* the ***** with which, in the first ********* of his ***********, he would ****** the ********** of Oliver's *********, to ***** him with the secret, when her *************** in the ****'* ****** could be ******** by no *********** person.  These were all ******* for the ******** ******* and most *********** ********* in ************* it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first ******* would ********** be to hold a ********** with the worthy doctor on the subject.  As to ********* to any ***** *******, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.  Once the thought ******** to her of ******* ********** from Harry; but this awakened the ************ of their last *******, and it seemed ******** of her to call him back, ****--*** tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this ***** of **********--** might have by this time ****** to ****** her, and to be ******* away. 

********* by these different ***********; ********* now to one course and then to another, and again ********* from all, as each ********** consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a ********* and anxious night.  After more ********* with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate ********** of ********** Harry. 

'If it be ******* to him,' she thought, 'to come back here, how ******* it will be to me!  But perhaps he will not come; he may *****, or he may come himself, and ********** ******* from ******* **--** did when he went away.  I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.'  And here Rose dropped the ***, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her ********* should not see her ****. 

She had taken up the same ***, and laid it down again ***** times, and had considered and ************ the first **** of her ****** without ******* the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a ****-*****, entered the room in such ********** ***** and violent *********, as seemed to ******* some new cause of alarm. 

'What ***** you look so ********?' asked Rose, ********* to **** him. 

'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be ******,' replied the boy. 'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!' 

'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose, ******** him.  'But what is ****?--** whom do you speak?' 

'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to **********, 'the gentleman who was so good to **--**. Brownlow, that we have so often ****** about.' 

'Where?' asked Rose. 

'******* out of a coach,' replied Oliver, ******** tears of *******, 'and going into a house.  I didn't speak to ***--* couldn't speak to him, for he didn't see me, and I ******** so, that I was not able to go up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, whether he ***** there, and they said he did.  Look here,' said Oliver, opening a ***** of paper, 'here it is; here's where he *****--*'* going there directly!  Oh, dear me, dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak 



With her attention not a little ********** by these and a great many other ********** ************ of joy, Rose read the *******, which was ****** Street, in the ******.  She very soon determined upon turning the ********* to account. 

'Quick!' she said.  'Tell them to ***** a *******-*****, and be ready to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss of time.  I will only tell my **** that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.' 

Oliver ****** no ********* to ********, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to ****** Street.  When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under ******** of ********* the old gentleman to ******* him; and ******* up her **** by the *******, ********* to see Mr. Brownlow on very ******** business.  The ******* soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an ***** room, Miss Maylie was presented to an ******* gentleman of ********** appearance, in a ******-***** coat.  At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in ******* ******** and *******; who did not look ************ **********, and who was sitting with his hands ******* on the top of a thick stick, and his **** ******* *********. 

'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the ******-***** coat, hastily rising with great **********, 'I beg your ******, young ****--* ******** it was some *********** person ***--* beg you will ****** me.  Be seated, 



'Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?' said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken. 

'That is my name,' said the old gentleman.  'This is my friend, Mr. Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?' 

'I believe,' interposed Miss Maylie, 'that at this ****** of our *********, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am ********* ********, he is ********* of the business on which I wish to speak to you.' 

Mr. Brownlow ******** his head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very ***** ***, and ***** from his chair, made another very ***** ***, and dropped into it again. 

'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said Rose, ********* ***********; 'but you once showed great *********** and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in ******* of him again.' 

'Indeed!' said Mr. Brownlow. 

'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose. 

The words no sooner ******* her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been ********* to *** into a large book that lay on the table, ***** it with a great *****, and falling back in his chair, ********** from his features every expression but one of *********** wonder, and ******** in a ********* and ****** *****; then, as if ******* of having ******** so much *******, he ****** himself, as it were, by a ********** into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him ******* a long deep *******, which seemed, at last, not to be ********** on empty air, but to die away in the ********* ******** of his *******. 

Mr. ******* was no less *********, although his astonishment was not ********* in the same ********* manner.  He drew his chair ****** to Miss ******'*, and said, 

'Do me the ******, my dear young lady, to leave ******** out of the question that goodness and *********** of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to ******* any ******** which will ***** the ************ opinion I was once ******* to ********* of that poor child, in ******'* name put me in ********** of it.' 

'A bad one!  I'll eat my head if he is not a bad one,' growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ************* power, without ****** a ****** of his face. 

'He is a child of a ***** nature and a **** heart,' said Rose, *********; 'and that Power which has thought fit to *** him beyond his years, has ******* in his breast ********** and feelings which would do honour to many who have ******** his days six times over.' 

'I'm only *****-***,' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same ***** face. 'And, as the *****'* in it if this Oliver is not ****** years old at least, I don't see the *********** of that remark.' 

'Do not **** my friend, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'he does not mean what he says.' 

'Yes, he does,' growled Mr. Grimwig. 

'No, he does not,' said Mr. Brownlow, ********* rising in ***** as he 



'He'll eat his head, if he *****'*,' growled Mr. Grimwig. 

'He would ******* to have it ******* off, if he does,' said Mr. 



'And he'd ********** like to see any man ***** to do it,' ********* Mr. Grimwig, ******** his stick upon the floor. 

Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen ********* took *****, and afterwards shook hands, ********* to their ********** ******. 

'Now, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to return to the subject in which your ******** is so much **********.  Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child:  ******** me to promise that I ********* every means in my power of *********** him, and that since I have been ****** from this country, my first ********** that he had ******* upon me, and had been ********* by his former ********** to *** me, has been ************ ******.' 

Rose, who had had time to ******* her thoughts, at once *******, in a few ******* words, all that had ******** Oliver since he left Mr. ********'* house; ********* *****'* *********** for that gentleman's ******* ear, and ********** with the ********* that his only ******, for some months past, had been not being able to **** with his former ********** and friend. 

'Thank God!' said the old gentleman.  'This is great happiness to me, great happiness.  But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.  You must ****** my finding ***** with ***,--*** why not have brought him?' 

'He is ******* in a coach at the door,' replied Rose. 

'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.  With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the **********, and into the coach, without another word. 

When the ****-**** closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig ****** up his head, and ********** one of the **** legs of his chair into a *****, ********* three ******** ******* with the ********** of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.  After ********** this *********, he rose and ****** as fast as he could up and down the room at least a ***** times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, ****** her without the ********* *******. 

'Hush!' he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this ******* **********.  'Don't be afraid.  I'm old enough to be your ***********. You're a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!' 

In fact, as he threw himself at one ********* **** into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very **********; and if the ************* of that moment had been the only ****** for all her ******* and care in Oliver's ******, Rose Maylie would have been well ******. 

'There is somebody else who should not be *********, by the ***,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* the bell.  'Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.' 

The old *********** answered the ******* with all ********; and ******** a ******* at the door, ****** for ******. 

'Why, you get ******* every day, Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, rather 



'Well, that I do, sir,' replied the old lady.  '******'* eyes, at my time of life, don't ******* with age, sir.' 

'I could have told you that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but put on your *******, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will 



The old lady began to ******* in her pocket for her **********. But Oliver's ******** was not proof against this new *****; and ******** to his first *******, he ****** into her arms. 

'God be good to me!' cried the old lady, ********* him; 'it is my ******** boy!' 

'My dear old *****!' cried Oliver. 

'He would come ****--* knew he would,' said the old lady, ******* him in her arms.  'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's *** he is ******* again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same **** eye, but not so ***.  I have never ********* them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a ********* young creature.'  Running on thus, and now ******* Oliver from her to **** how he had *****, now ******** him to her and passing her ******* ****** through his hair, the good soul laughed and **** upon his neck by turns. 

Leaving her and Oliver to ******* ***** at *******, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full ********* of her ********* with Nancy, which ********** him no little surprise and **********.  Rose also ********* her ******* for not ********* in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first ********.  The old gentleman considered that she had ***** *********, and ******* ********* to hold ****** ********** with the worthy doctor himself.  To ****** him an early opportunity for the ********* of this ******, it was ******** that he should call at the ***** at ***** o'clock that evening, and that in the ******** Mrs. Maylie should be ********** ******** of all that had ********.  These ************* ********, Rose and Oliver returned home. 

Rose had by no means ********* the ******* of the good ******'* *****. *****'* history was no sooner ******** to him, than he ****** forth a ****** of ******* ******* and ***********; ********** to make her the first ****** of the ******** ********* of ******. Blathers and Duff; and ******** put on his hat *********** to ******** forth to ****** the ********** of those ********.  And, *********, he would, in this first ********, have carried the ********* into effect without a moment's consideration of the ************, if he had not been **********, in part, by ************* violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an ********* ***********, and party by such ********* and *************** as seemed best ********** to ******** him from his ********** purpose. 

'Then what the devil is to be done?' said the ********* doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies.  'Are we to **** a **** of ****** to all these *********, **** and female, and beg them to ****** a ******* pounds, or so, ******, as a ******** **** of our ******, and some slight ************** of their ******** to Oliver?' 

'Not ******* that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow, ********; 'but we must ******* gently and with great care.' 

'********** and care,' exclaimed the doctor.  'I'd send them one and all to--' 

'Never mind where,' interposed Mr. Brownlow.  'But ******* whether ******* them ******** is ****** to ****** the object we have in view.' 

'What object?' asked the doctor. 

'******, the ********* of Oliver's *********, and ********* for him the *********** of which, if this story be true, he has been ************ 



'Ah!' said Mr. Losberne, ******* himself with his ******-************; 'I almost ****** that.' 

'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; '******* this poor girl ******** out of the question, and ********* it were possible to bring these ********** to justice without ************ her ******, what good should we bring about?' 

'******* a few of them at least, in all ***********,' ********* the doctor, 'and ************ the rest.' 

'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the ******* of time, and if we step in to ********* them, it ***** to me that we shall be ********** a very ******** ***, in ****** ********** to our own ********--** at least to Oliver's, which is the same thing.' 

'How?' inquired the doctor. 

'Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have ******* ********** in ******* to the ****** of this *******, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by *********, and by catching him when he is not ********** by these people.  For, suppose he were ***********, we have no proof against him.  He is not even (so far as we know, or as the ***** ****** to us) ********* with the **** in any of their *********. If he were not **********, it is very ******** that he could ******* any further ********** than being ********* to ****** as a ***** and ********; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so *********** closed that he might as well, for our ********, be ****, ****, *****, and an *****.' 

'Then,' said the doctor ***********, 'I put it to you again, whether you think it ********** that this promise to the girl should be considered *******; a promise made with the best and ******* **********, but really--' 

'Do not ******* the point, my dear young lady, pray,' said Mr. Brownlow, ************ Rose as she was about to speak. 'The promise shall be kept.  I don't think it will, in the ********* ******, ********* with our ***********.  But, before we can ******* upon any ******* course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ********* from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the ************* that he is to be ***** with by us, and not by the ***; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to ******* from her such an account of his ****** and *********** of his person, as will ****** us to ******** him.  She cannot be seen until next ****** night; this is *******.  I would ******* that in the ********, we ****** perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.' 

Although Mr. Losberne received with many *** faces a ******** ********* a ***** of five whole days, he was **** to ***** that no better course ******** to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie ***** very ******** with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's *********** was carried 



'I should like,' he said, 'to call in the *** of my friend Grimwig.  He is a strange creature, but a ****** one, and might ***** of ******** ********** to us; I should say that he was **** a ******, and ******* the *** in ******* because he had only one brief and a ****** of course, in twenty years, though whether that is ************** or not, you must ********* for **********.' 

'I have no ********* to your ******* in your friend if I may call in mine,' said the doctor. 

'We must put it to the ****,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'who may he be?' 

'That ****'* ***, and this young ****'*--**** old friend,' said the doctor, ********* towards Mrs. Maylie, and ********** with an ********** glance at her *****. 

Rose ******* ******, but she did not make any ******* ********* to this ****** (******** she felt in a ******** ********); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were *********** added to the *********. 

'We **** in town, of course,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'while there ******* the ********* ******** of *********** this inquiry with a ****** of *******.  I will ***** neither trouble nor ******* in ****** of the object in which we are all so ****** **********, and I am ******* to ****** here, if it be for ****** months, so long as you ****** me that any hope *******.' 

'Good!' rejoined Mr. Brownlow.  'And as I see on the faces about me, a *********** to ******* how it happened that I was not in the way to *********** Oliver's ****, and had so suddenly left the *******, let me ********* that I shall be asked no ********* until such time as I may **** it ********* to ********* them by ******* my own story.  Believe me, I make this ******* with good reason, for I might ********* ****** ***** ******** never to be ********, and only ******** ************ and *************** already quite ******** enough.  Come!  ****** has been *********, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have ***** to think, by this time, that we have ******* of his company, and entered into some dark ********** to thrust him forth upon the 



With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and ******** her into the ******-****.  Mr. Losberne followed, ******* Rose; and the ******* was, for the present, *********** broken up. 





CHAPTER **** 

AN OLD ************ OF OLIVER'S, ********** ******* ***** OF ******, ******* A PUBLIC ********* IN THE ********** 

Upon the night when Nancy, having ****** Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her ****-******* ******* to Rose Maylie, there ******** towards London, by the Great ***** Road, two *******, upon whom it is ********* that this history should ****** some attention. 

They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better ********* as a **** and female:  for the former was one of those ****-******, *****-*****, *********, **** people, to whom it is ********* to ****** any ******* ***,--******* as they do, when they are yet boys, like ********** men, and when they are almost men, like ********* boys.  The woman was young, but of a ****** and ***** make, as she need have been to bear the ****** of the heavy ****** which was ******** to her back. Her companion was not ********** with much *******, as there merely ******* from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small ****** ******* in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.  This ************, added to the length of his legs, which were of ******* ******, ******* him with much **** to keep some ****-***** ***** in ******* of his companion, to whom he ************ turned with an ********* **** of the head:  as if *********** her *********, and ****** her to ******* ********. 

Thus, they had ****** along the ***** road, taking little **** of any object within sight, save when they ******* ***** to ***** a ***** passage for the ****-******* which were ******** out of town, until they passed through ******** *******; when the ******** ********* stopped and called impatiently to his companion, 

'Come on, can't yer?  What a ********* yer are, Charlotte.' 

'It's a heavy ****, I can tell you,' said the female, coming up, almost ********** with *******. 

'Heavy!  What are yer talking about?  What are yer made for?' rejoined the **** *********, ******** his own little ****** as he spoke, to the other shoulder.  'Oh, there yer are, ******* again! Well, if yer ain't enough to **** *******'* ******** out, I don't know what is!' 

'Is it much *******?' asked the woman, ******* herself against a ****, and looking up with the ************ ********* from her face. 

'Much *******!  Yer as good as there,' said the ****-****** *******, pointing out before him.  'Look there!  Those are the ****** of London.' 

'They're a good two **** off, at least,' said the woman ************. 

'Never mind whether they're two **** off, or twenty,' said Noah Claypole; for he it was; 'but get up and come on, or I'll **** yer, and so I give yer notice.' 

As ****'* red nose grew ****** with *****, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if ***** ******** to put his ****** into *********, the woman rose without any further remark, and ******* ****** by his 



'Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?' she asked, after they had walked a few ******* *****. 

'How should I know?' replied Noah, whose ****** had been ************ ******** by walking. 

'Near, I hope,' said Charlotte. 

'No, not near,' replied Mr. Claypole.  'There!  Not near; so don't think it.' 

'Why not?' 

'When I tell yer that I don't mean to do a thing, that's enough, without any why or because either,' replied Mr. Claypole with *******. 

'Well, you *****'* be so *****,' said his companion. 

'A pretty thing it would be, wouldn't it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might **** in his old nose, and have us taken back in a **** with ********* on,' said Mr. Claypole in a ******* tone.  'No!  I shall go and lose myself among the ********* streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very ***-**-***-****** house I can set eyes on. '***, yer may ****** yer ***** I've got a head; for if we ****'* gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, ***'* have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.  And ***** yer right for being a ****.' 

'I know I ain't as ******* as you are,' replied Charlotte; 'but don't put all the ***** on me, and say I should have been locked up.  You would have been if I had been, any way.' 

'Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,' said Mr. Claypole. 

'I took it for you, Noah, dear,' rejoined Charlotte. 

'Did I keep it?' asked Mr. Claypole. 

'No; you ******* in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,' said the lady, ******** him under the ****, and drawing her arm through his. 

This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. ********'* ***** to ****** a ***** and ******* ********** in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had ******* Charlotte to this ******, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her:  which would leave him an opportunity of ********* his ********* of any *****, and would ******* ********** his ******* of ******.  Of course, he entered at this ********, into no *********** of his *******, and they walked on very ******** together. 

In ********* of this ******** ****, Mr. Claypole went on, without *******, until he arrived at the ***** at *********, where he ****** ******, from the crowd of ********** and ******* of ********, that London began in earnest.  Just ******* to ******* which appeared the most crowded streets, and ************ the most to be *******, he crossed into ***** ****'* Road, and was soon deep in the ********* of the ********* and dirty ****, which, lying between ****'* *** **** and **********, ****** that part of the town one of the ****** and ***** that *********** has left in the ***** of London. 

Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, ******** Charlotte after him; now ******** into the ****** to ******* at a glance the whole ******** ********* of some small public-house; now ******* on again, as some ******* appearance ******* him to believe it too public for his purpose.  At length, he stopped in front of one, more ****** in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and ******** it from the opposite ********, ********** ********* his ********* of putting up there, for the night. 

'So give us the ******,' said Noah, *********** it from the *****'* shoulders, and ******** it over his own; 'and don't yer speak, except when yer spoke to.  What's the name of the *****--*-*-*--***** what?' 

'********,' said Charlotte. 

'Three ********,' repeated Noah, 'and a very good **** too.  Now, then! Keep close at my *****, and come along.'  With these ***********, he ****** the ******** door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion. 

There was nobody in the *** but a young Jew, who, with his two ****** on the *******, was ******* a dirty *********. He ****** very hard at Noah, and Noah ****** very hard at him. 

If Noah had been ******* in his *******-***'* *****, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so ****; but as he had ********* the coat and *****, and **** a short *****-***** over his ********, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance ******** so much attention in a public-house. 

'Is this the Three ********?' asked Noah. 

'That is the **** of this '****,' replied the Jew. 

'A gentleman we *** on the road, coming up from the country, *********** us here,' said Noah, ******* Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ********* ****** for ********** *******, and perhaps to **** her to ****** no surprise.  'We want to sleep here 



'*'* *** ******* you ***,' said Barney, who was the ********* ******; 'but I'll *******.' 

'Show us the ***, and give us a bit of cold **** and a drop of **** while yer *********, will yer?' said Noah. 

Barney ******** by ******** them into a small ****-****, and ******* the ******** ****** before them; having done which, he ******** the ********** that they could be ****** that night, and left the ******* couple to their ***********. 

Now, this ****-**** was immediately behind the ***, and some steps lower, so that any person ********* with the house, ********* a small ******* which ********* a ****** **** of glass fixed in the wall of the ****-***** *********, about five feet from its ********, could not only look down upon any ****** in the ****-**** without any great ****** of being observed (the glass being in a dark ***** of the wall, between which and a large ******* **** the ******** had to thrust himself), but could, by ******** his ear to the *********, ********* with ********* ************, their subject of conversation.  The ******** of the house had not ********* his eye from this place of ****** for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the ************* above *******, when Fagin, in the course of his *******'* business, came into the *** to ******* after some of his young ******. 

'Hush!' said Barney:  '********** id the next ****.' 

'*********!' repeated the old man in a whisper. 

'Ah!  ** *** *** too,' added Barney.  '**** the ******, but ******* in your way, or *'* ********.' 

Fagin appeared to ******* this ************* with great interest. 

******** a *****, he ********** ******* his eye to the **** of glass, from which secret **** he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold **** from the ****, and ****** from the ***, and ************* *********** ***** of both to Charlotte, who sat ********* by, ****** and ******** at his 



'***!' he whispered, looking round to Barney, 'I like that ******'* looks.  He'd be of use to us; he knows how to ***** the girl already. Don't make as much noise as a *****, my dear, and let me hear 'em ****--*** me hear 'em.' 

He again ******* his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the *********, listened ***********:  with a ****** and ***** look upon his face, that might have *********** to some old ******. 

'So I mean to be a gentleman,' said Mr. Claypole, ******* out his legs, and ********** a conversation, the ************ of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. 'No more ***** old *******, Charlotte, but a gentleman's life for me:  and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.' 

'I should like that well enough, dear,' replied Charlotte; 'but ***** ain't to be ******* every day, and people to get clear off after it.' 

'***** be ******!' said Mr. Claypole; 'there's more things besides ***** to be *******.' 

'What do you mean?' asked his companion. 

'Pockets, *****'* *********, houses, ****-*******, *****!' said Mr. Claypole, rising with the ******. 

'But you can't do all that, dear,' said Charlotte. 

'I shall look out to get into company with them as can,' replied Noah. '****'** be able to make us ****** some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth ***** women; I never see such a ******** *** and ********* ******* as yer can be when I let yer.' 

'***, how **** it is to hear yer say so!' exclaimed Charlotte, ********** a **** upon his **** face. 

'There, ****'** do:  don't yer be too ************, in case I'm ***** with yer,' said Noah, *********** himself with great *******.  'I should like to be the ******* of some ****, and have the ******** of 'em, and ********* 'em about, ********* to themselves.  That would suit me, if there was good ******; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be ***** at that ******-***** **** you've ***,--********** as we don't very well know how to get *** of it *********.' 

After ********** this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the ******-*** with an ****** of deep ******; and having well ****** its ********, nodded *************** to Charlotte, and took a *******, ********* he appeared ******* *********.  He was ********** another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, *********** him. 

The stranger was Mr. Fagin.  And very ******* he looked, and a very low *** he made, as he ********, and ******* himself down at the ******* table, ******* something to drink of the ******** Barney. 

'A pleasant night, sir, but **** for the time of year,' said Fagin, ******* his hands.  'From the country, I see, sir?' 

'How do yer see that?' asked Noah Claypole. 

'We have not so much **** as that in London,' replied Fagin, pointing from ****'* ***** to those of his companion, and from them to the two 



'Yer a sharp ******,' said Noah.  'Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!' 

'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew, ******* his voice to a ************ whisper; 'and that's the truth.' 

Fagin followed up this remark by ******** the side of his nose with his right **********,--* ******* which Noah ********* to *******, though not with ******** *******, in *********** of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose.  However, Mr. Fagin seemed to ********* the ********* as ********** a ******* *********** with his opinion, and put about the ****** which Barney ********** with, in a very ******** 



'Good ***** that,' observed Mr. Claypole, ******** his lips. 

'Dear!' said Fagin.  'A man need be always ******** a till, or a pocket, or a *****'* ********, or a house, or a ****-*****, or a ****, if he ****** it *********.' 

Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this ******* from his own ******* than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of **** ******** and ********* ******. 

'Don't mind me, my dear,' said Fagin, drawing his chair ******. 'Ha! ha! it was ***** it was only me that heard you by ******. It was very ***** it was only me.' 

'I didn't take it,' ********* Noah, no longer ********** out his legs like an *********** gentleman, but ******* them up as well as he could under his chair; 'it was all her doing; ***'** got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.' 

'No matter ***'* got it, or who did it, my dear,' replied Fagin, glancing, ************, with a ****'* eye at the girl and the two *******.  'I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.' 

'In what way?' asked Mr. Claypole, a little **********. 

'In that way of business,' rejoined Fagin; 'and so are the people of the house.  You've *** the right **** upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be.  There is not a ***** place in all this town than is the ********; that is, when I like to make it so.  And I have taken a ***** to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may make your ***** ****.' 

Noah ********'* mind might have been at **** after this *********, but his body certainly was not; for he ******** and ******* about, into various ******* *********:  ****** his new friend meanwhile with ******* fear and *********. 

'I'll tell you more,' said Fagin, after he had ********* the girl, by **** of ******** **** and muttered **************. 'I have got a friend that I think can ******* your ******* wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take ******** ********** of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be ****** all the others.' 

'Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,' replied Noah. 

'What ********* would it be to me to be anything else?' inquired Fagin, ********* his shoulders.  'Here!  Let me have a word with you outside.' 

'There's no occasion to trouble ********* to ****,' said Noah, ******* his legs by ******* ******* ****** again. '***'** take the ******* upstairs the while.  Charlotte, see to them *******.' 

This *******, which had been ********* with great *******, was ****** without the ********* *****; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the ******** while Noah held the door open and watched her out. 

'She's kept ********* well under, ain't she?' he asked as he resumed his seat:  in the tone of a ****** who had ***** some **** ******. 

'Quite *******,' rejoined Fagin, ******** him on the shoulder. 'You're a ******, my dear.' 

'Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I *******'* be here,' replied Noah. 'But, I say, ***'** be back if yer lose time.' 

'Now, what do you think?' said Fagin.  'If you was to like my friend, could you do better than **** him?' 

'Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!' ********* Noah, ******* one of his little eyes. 

'The top of the ****; ******* a power of hands; has the very best society in the **********.' 

'******* ****-******?' asked Mr. Claypole. 

'Not a ********** among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on my **************, if he didn't run rather short of ********** just now,' replied Fagin. 

'Should I have to hand over?' said Noah, ******** his ********-******. 

'It couldn't ******** be done without,' replied Fagin, in a most ******* manner. 

'Twenty pound, ******--**'* a *** of money!' 

'Not when it's in a **** you can't get *** of,' retorted Fagin. 'Number and **** taken, I suppose?  ******* stopped at the ****? Ah!  It's not worth much to him.  **'** have to go ******, and he couldn't **** it for a great deal in the ******.' 

'When could I see him?' asked Noah **********. 

'To-morrow morning.' 









'**!' said Noah.  'What's the *****?' 

'Live like a *********--***** and *******, ***** and spirits ****--**** of all you ****, and half of all the young woman *****,' replied Mr. 



Whether Noah Claypole, whose ******** was none of the least *************, would have ******* even to these ******* *****, had he been a perfectly free *****, is very ********; but as he *********** that, in the ***** of his *******, it was in the power of his new ************ to give him up to justice immediately (and more ******** things had come to ****), he gradually ********, and said he thought that would suit him. 

'But, yer see,' observed Noah, 'as she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.' 

'A little ***** work?' ********* Fagin. 

'Ah! something of that sort,' replied Noah.  'What do you think would suit me now?  Something not too ****** for the strength, and not very *********, you know.  That's the sort of thing!' 

'I heard you talk of something in the *** way upon the others, my dear,' said Fagin.  'My friend ***** somebody who would do that well, very much.' 

'Why, I did ******* that, and I *******'* mind turning my hand to it sometimes,' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; 'but it wouldn't pay by itself, you know.' 

'That's true!' observed the Jew, ********** or ********** to ********. 'No, it might not.' 

'What do you think, then?' asked Noah, ********* ********* him. 'Something in the ******** way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more **** than being at home.' 

'What do you think of the old ladies?' asked Fagin. 'There's a good deal of money made in ********* their **** and *******, and running round the corner.' 

'Don't they ****** out a good deal, and ******* sometimes?' asked Noah, shaking his head.  'I don't think that would answer my purpose.  Ain't there any other **** open?' 

'Stop!' said Fagin, laying his hand on ****'* ****.  'The ******* lay.' 

'What's that?' demanded Mr. Claypole. 

'The ********, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent on ******* by their *******, with ********* and *********; and the lay is just to take their money ****--****'** always got it ready in their *****,--**** ***** 'em into the ******, and walk off very ****, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child ****** down and **** itself.  Ha! ha! ha!' 

'Ha! ha!' ****** Mr. Claypole, ******* up his legs in an *******. '****, that's the very thing!' 

'To be sure it is,' replied Fagin; 'and you can have a few good ***** ******* out in ****** Town, and ****** Bridge, and ************* like that, where they're always going *******; and you can ***** as many ******** as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!' 

With this, Fagin ***** Mr. Claypole in the side, and they ****** in a burst of ******** both long and loud. 

'Well, that's all right!' said Noah, when he had ********* himself, and Charlotte had returned.  'What time to-morrow shall we say?' 

'Will ten do?' asked Fagin, ******, as Mr. Claypole nodded ******, 'What name shall I tell my good friend.' 

'Mr. Bolter,' replied Noah, who had ******** himself for such *********.  'Mr. ****** Bolter.  This is Mrs. Bolter.' 

'Mrs. ******'* ****** *******,' said Fagin, ****** with ********* **********.  'I hope I shall know her better very *******.' 

'Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?' ********* Mr. Claypole. 

'Yes, Noah, dear!' replied Mrs. Bolter, ********* her hand. 

'She ***** me Noah, as a sort of **** way of talking,' said Mr. ****** Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.  'You understand?' 

'Oh yes, I **********--*********,' replied Fagin, ******* the truth for once.  '****-*****!  ****-*****!' 

With many ****** and good ******, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole, ********** his good ****'* attention, proceeded to ********* her ******** to the *********** he had made, with all that *********** and air of ***********, ********, not only a ****** of the ******* ***, but a gentleman who *********** the ******* of a ******* *********** on the ******* lay, in London and its ********. 





CHAPTER ***** 

******* IS ***** HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE 

'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?' asked Mr. Claypole, ********* Bolter, when, by ****** of the ******* entered into between them, he had ******* next day to *****'* house.  ''***, I thought as much last night!' 

'Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied Fagin, with his most *********** grin.  'He ****'* as good a one as himself ********.' 

'Except sometimes,' replied ****** Bolter, ******** the air of a man of the world.  'Some people are ******'* ******* but their own, yer know.' 

'Don't believe that,' said Fagin.  'When a man's his own *****, it's only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's ******* for ********* but himself.  ****! ****!  There ain't such a thing in 



'There *****'* to be, if there is,' replied Mr. Bolter. 

'That ****** to reason.  Some ********* say that number three is the ***** number, and some say number *****.  It's neither, my friend, neither.  It's number one. 

'Ha! ha!' cried Mr. Bolter.  'Number one for ever.' 

'In a little ********* like ****, my dear,' said Fagin, who felt it necessary to ******* this position, 'we have a ******* number one, without *********** me too as the same, and all the other young people.' 

'Oh, the devil!' exclaimed Mr. Bolter. 

'You see,' pursued Fagin, ********* to ********* this ************, 'we are so ***** up together, and ********** in our *********, that it must be so.  For ********, it's your object to take care of number ***--******* yourself.' 

'Certainly,' replied Mr. Bolter.  'Yer about right there.' 

'Well!  You can't take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.' 

'Number two, you mean,' said Mr. Bolter, who was ******* ******* with the ******* of ***********. 

'No, I don't!' retorted Fagin.  'I'm of the same ********** to you, as you are to yourself.' 

'I say,' *********** Mr. Bolter, 'yer a very **** man, and I'm very **** of yer; but we ain't quite so thick together, as all that comes 



'Only think,' said Fagin, ********* his shoulders, and ********** out his hands; 'only ********.  You've done what's a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the ****** round your throat, that's so very ****** **** and so very ********* to *******--** ***** *******, the ******!' 

Mr. Bolter put his hand to his ***********, as if he felt it ************** *****; and ******** an ******, ********* in tone but not in *********. 

'The *******,' continued Fagin, 'the *******, my dear, is an **** ******-****, which ****** out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a **** ******'* ****** on the ***** *******.  To keep in the **** road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with 



'Of course it is,' replied Mr. Bolter.  'What do yer talk about such things for?' 

'Only to show you my ******* *******,' said the Jew, raising his ********.  'To be able to do that, you ****** upon me. To keep my little business all ****, I ****** upon you. The first is your number one, the second my number one.  The more you ***** your number one, the more ******* you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at *****--**** a ****** for number one ***** us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to ****** in company.' 

'That's true,' rejoined Mr. Bolter, ************.  'Oh! yer a ******* old ******!' 

Mr. Fagin saw, with *******, that this ******* to his ****** was no mere **********, but that he had really ********* his ******* with a sense of his **** ******, which it was most ********* that he should ********* in the ****** of their ************.  To ********** an ********** so ********* and ******, he followed up the blow by *********** him, in some ******, with the ********* and ****** of his **********; ******** truth and ******* together, as best ****** his purpose; and ******** both to bear, with so much ***, that Mr. ******'* ******* ******* *********, and became ********, at the same time, with a ****** of ********* fear, which it was ****** ********* to ******. 

'It's this ****** ***** we have in each other that ******** me under heavy ******,' said Fagin.  'My best hand was taken from me, ********* 



'You don't mean to say he died?' cried Mr. Bolter. 

'No, no,' replied Fagin, 'not so bad as that.  Not quite so bad.' 

'What, I suppose he was--' 

'Wanted,' interposed Fagin.  'Yes, he was wanted.' 

'Very particular?' inquired Mr. Bolter. 

'No,' replied Fagin, 'not very.  He was ******* with ********** to **** a pocket, and they found a ****** *****-*** on ***,--*** own, my dear, his own, for he took ***** himself, and was very **** of it.  They ******** him till **-***, for they thought they knew the *****.  Ah! he was worth ***** *****, and I'd give the ***** of as many to have him back.  You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.' 

'Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don't yer think so?' said Mr. 



'I'm ******** about it,' replied Fagin, with a ****.  'If they don't get any fresh ********, **'** only be a ******* **********, and we shall have him back again after six ***** or so; but, if they do, it's a case of *******.  They know what a ****** lad he is; he'll be a *****.  ****'** make the Artful nothing less than a *****.' 

'What do you mean by ******* and a *****?' demanded Mr. Bolter. 'What's the good of talking in that way to me; why don't yer speak so as I can understand yer?' 

Fagin was about to ********* these ********** *********** into the ****** ******; and, being ***********, Mr. Bolter would have been ******** that they *********** that *********** of words, '************** for life,' when the ******** was cut short by the ***** of Master Bates, with his hands in his ********-*******, and his face ******* into a look of ****-******* ***. 

'It's all up, Fagin,' said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other. 

'What do you mean?' 

'****'** found the gentleman as **** the box; two or three ****'* a coming to '******* him; and the ******'* ****** for a passage out,' replied Master Bates.  'I must have a full suit of ********, Fagin, and a *******, to ***** him in, afore he **** out upon his *******.  To think of **** *******--***** ****--*** ******--*** Artful ******--***** ****** for a common ********-********* ******-***!  I never thought he'd a done it under a gold watch, *****, and *****, at the ******. Oh, why didn't he *** some **** old gentleman of all his ********, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common ****, without no honour nor *****!' 

With this expression of feeling for his *********** friend, Master Bates sat himself on the ******* chair with an ****** of ******* and 



'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor ***** for!' exclaimed Fagin, ******* an ***** look at his *****. 'Wasn't he always the ***-****** among you all!  Is there one of you that could ***** him or come near him on any *****!  Eh?' 

'Not one,' replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered ***** by ******; 'not one.' 

'Then what do you talk of?' replied Fagin *******; 'what are you ********** for?' 

''Cause it isn't on the ***-***, is it?' said Charley, ****** into ******* ******** of his ********* friend by the ******* of his *******; ''cause it can't come out in the '********; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was.  How will he stand in the ******* ********? *'**** not be there at all.  Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!' 

'Ha! ha!' cried Fagin, ********* his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of ********* which shook him as though he had the *****; 'see what a ***** they take in their **********, my dear.  Ain't it beautiful?' 

Mr. Bolter nodded ******, and Fagin, after ************* the ***** of Charley Bates for some ******* with ******* satisfaction, ******* up to that young gentleman and ****** him on the shoulder. 

'Never mind, Charley,' said Fagin **********; '**'** come out, **'** be sure to come out.  ****'** all know what a ****** fellow he was; he'll show it himself, and not ******** his old **** and ********.  Think how young he is too!  What a ***********, Charley, to be ****** at his time of life!' 

'Well, it is a honour that is!' said Charley, a little ********. 

'He shall have all he *****,' continued the Jew.  'He shall be kept in the Stone ***, Charley, like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman!  With his **** every day, and money in his pocket to ***** and **** with, if he can't ***** it.' 

'No, shall he though?' cried Charley Bates. 

'**, that he shall,' replied Fagin, 'and we'll have a ***-***, Charley: one that's got the ******** **** of the ***:  to carry on his *******; and he shall make a ****** for himself too, if he *****; and we'll read it all in the ******--"****** ******--******* of ********--**** the ***** was *********"--**, Charley, eh?' 

'Ha! ha!' laughed Master Bates, 'what a **** that would be, wouldn't it, Fagin?  I say, how the Artful would ****** 'em wouldn't he?' 

'Would!' cried Fagin.  'He *****--** will!' 

'Ah, to be sure, so he will,' repeated Charley, ******* his hands. 

'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, ******* his eyes upon his *****. 

'So do I,' cried Charley Bates.  'Ha! ha! ha! so do I.  I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.  What a game!  What a ******* game! All the ***-**** ****** to look ******, and **** Dawkins ********** of 'em as ******** and *********** as if he was the *****'* own *** making a ****** ***** ******--**! ha! ha!' 

In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well ******** his young friend's ********* ***********, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to ******** the ********** Dodger rather in the light of a ******, now looked upon him as the ***** ***** in a scene of most ******** and ********* ******, and felt quite ********* for the ******* of the time when his old companion should have so ********** an opportunity of ********** his *********. 

'We must know how he **** on **-***, by some ***** means or other,' said Fagin.  'Let me think.' 

'Shall I go?' asked Charley. 

'Not for the world,' replied Fagin.  'Are you mad, my dear, ***** mad, that ***'* walk into the very place *****--**, Charley, no. One is enough to lose at a time.' 

'You don't mean to go yourself, I suppose?' said Charley with a ******** ****. 

'That wouldn't quite fit,' replied Fagin shaking his head. 

'Then why don't you send this new ****?' asked Master Bates, laying his hand on ****'* arm.  'Nobody knows him.' 

'Why, if he didn't mind--' observed Fagin. 

'Mind!' interposed Charley.  'What should he have to mind?' 

'Really nothing, my dear,' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, 'really 



'Oh, I **** say about that, yer know,' observed Noah, ******* towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of ***** alarm.  'No, **--**** of that.  It's not in my **********, that ain't.' 

'Wot ********** has he got, Fagin?' inquired Master Bates, ********* ****'* **** form with much *******.  'The ******* away when there's anything wrong, and the ****** all the ******* when there's everything right; is that his ******?' 

'Never mind,' retorted Mr. Bolter; 'and don't yer take ********* with yer *********, little boy, or ***'** find ******* in the wrong shop.' 

Master Bates laughed so ********** at this *********** ******, that it was some time before Fagin could *********, and ********* to Mr. Bolter that he ******** no possible danger in ******** the ******-******; that, ******** as no account of the little ****** in which he had *******, nor any *********** of his person, had yet been ********* to the **********, it was very ******** that he was not even ********* of having ******** to it for *******; and that, if he were ******** *********, it would be as safe a spot for him to ***** as any in London, ******** as it would be, of all ******, the very last, to which he could be supposed ****** to ****** of his own free will. 

*********, in part, by these ***************, but ********* in a much ******* ****** by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length *********, with a very bad *****, to ********* the **********. By *****'* **********, he immediately *********** for his own ******, a ********'* *****, ********* ********, and ******* ********:  all of which ******** the Jew had at hand.  He was ******** ********* with a felt hat well ********* with ******** *******; and a ******'* ****.  Thus ********, he was to ******* into the office, as some country fellow from ****** ****** ****** might be supposed to do for the ************* of his **********; and as he was as *******, ********, and ***-***** a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to 



These ************ *********, he was ******** of the necessary ***** and ****** by which to ********* the Artful Dodger, and was ******** by Master Bates through dark and ******* **** to within a very short distance of *** Street. Having ********* the ******* ********* of the office, and accompanied it with ******* ********** how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and **** off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates **** him ***** on alone, and ******** to **** his return on the spot of their *******. 

Noah Claypole, or ****** Bolter as the ****** *******, ********** followed the ********** he had received, *****--****** Bates being pretty well ********** with the ********--**** so ***** that he was ******* to **** the *********** presence without ****** any question, or ******* with any ************ by the way. 

He found himself ******* among a crowd of people, ******* women, who were ******* together in a dirty ****** room, at the ***** end of which was a raised ******** ****** off from the rest, with a **** for the ********* on the left hand against the wall, a box for the ********* in the ******, and a **** for the *********** on the right; the ***** ******** last *****, being ******** off by a ********* which ********* the ***** from the common ****, and left the ****** to ******* (if they could) the full ******* of justice. 

There were only a couple of women in the ****, who were ******* to their ******** friends, while the ***** read some *********** to a couple of ********* and a man in ***** clothes who ***** over the table.  A ****** stood ********* against the ****-****, ******* his nose ********** with a large key, except when he ********* an ***** ******** to conversation among the ******, by *********** silence; or looked ******* up to *** some woman 'Take that **** out,' when the ******* of justice was ********* by ****** *****, ****-********* in the ******'* *****, from some ****** ******.  The room ***** close and ***********; the walls were ****-***********; and the ******* *********.  There was an old ***** **** over the ******-*****, and a ***** ***** above the ****--*** only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for *********, or *******, or an ******** ************ with both, had left a ***** on all the ******* matter, hardly less ********** than the thick ****** **** on every ********* object that ******* upon it. 

Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that ************* *********'* mother or ******, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong *********** to his father, nobody at all ********* the *********** given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.  He ****** in a state of much ******** and *********** until the women, being ********* for *****, went ********* out; and then was quickly ******** by the appearance of another ******** who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his *****. 

It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, ********* into the office with the *** coat ******* ****** up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, ******** the ******, with a ******* **** ********** *************, and, taking his place in the ****, ********* in an ******* voice to know what he was placed in that '*** *********** ********** for. 

'Hold your ******, will you?' said the ******. 

'I'm an **********, ain't I?' rejoined the Dodger.  'Where are my 



'You'll get your ********** soon enough,' retorted the ******, 'and ****** with 'em.' 

'We'll see wot the ********* of State for the Home ******* has got to say to the *****, if I don't,' replied Mr. Dawkins.  'Now then!  Wot is this here business?  I shall thank the ****'******* to ******* of this here little ******, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I've got an *********** with a ******** in the ****, and as I am a man of my word and **** ******** in business matters, he'll go away if I ain't there to my time, and then **'*** **** won't be an action for ****** against them as *** me away.  Oh no, certainly not!' 

At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to *********** to be had **********, ******* the ****** to *********** 'the ***** of them two ***** as was on the *****.'  Which so ******* the **********, that they laughed almost as ******** as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the *******. 

'Silence there!' cried the ******. 

'What is this?' inquired one of the ***********. 

'A ****-********* case, your worship.' 

'Has the boy ever been here before?' 

'He ought to have been, a many times,' replied the ******. 'He has been pretty well ********** else.  _I_ know him well, your worship.' 

'Oh! you know me, do you?' cried the Artful, making a **** of the *********.  '**** good.  That's a case of *********** of *********, any 



Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence. 

'Now then, where are the *********?' said the *****. 

'Ah! that's right,' added the Dodger.  'Where are they?  I should like to see 'em.' 

This wish was immediately *********, for a ********* ******* forward who had seen the ******** ******* the pocket of an ******* gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief *********, which, being a very old one, he ************ put back again, after ****** it on his own countenance.  For this reason, he took the Dodger into ******* as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being ********, had upon his person a ****** *****-***, with the *****'* name ******** upon the ***.  This gentleman had been ********** on ********* to the ***** *****, and being then and there present, ***** that the *****-*** was his, and that he had ****** it on the previous day, the moment he had ********** himself from the crowd before ******** to.  He had also ******** a young gentleman in the ******, ************ ****** in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the ******** before him. 

'Have you anything to ask this *******, boy?' said the magistrate. 

'I wouldn't ***** myself by ********** to hold no conversation with him,' replied the Dodger. 

'Have you anything to say at all?' 

'Do you hear his worship ask if you've anything to say?' inquired the ******, ******* the silent Dodger with his *****. 

'I beg your ******,' said the Dodger, looking up with an air of ***********.  'Did you ******* yourself to me, my man?' 

'I never see such an ***-***-*** young ********, your worship,' observed the officer with a grin.  'Do you mean to say anything, you young ******?' 

'No,' replied the Dodger, 'not here, for this ain't the shop for justice:  besides which, my ******** is *-************ this morning with the **** ********* of the House of *******; but I shall have something to say *********, and so will he, and so will a **** ******** and '********* ****** of ************ **'** make them ***** wish ****'* never been born, or that ****'* got their ******* to **** 'em up to their own ***-****, afore they let 'em come out this morning to *** it on upon me.  I'll--' 

'There!  He's ***** *********!' interposed the *****. 'Take him away.' 

'Come on,' said the ******. 

'Oh ah!  I'll come on,' replied the Dodger, ******** his hat with the **** of his hand.  'Ah! (to the *****) it's no use your looking frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a **'***** of it.  _You'll_ pay for this, my fine *******.  I wouldn't be you for something!  I wouldn't go free, now, if you was to **** down on your knees and ask me.  Here, carry me off to ******!  Take me away!' 

With these last words, the Dodger ******** himself to be led off by the ******; ***********, till he got into the ****, to make a ************* business of it; and then ******** in the *******'* face, with great **** and ****-********. 

Having seen him locked up by himself in a little ****, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After ******* here some time, he was ****** by that young gentleman, who had ********* ********* from ******* himself until he had looked carefully ****** from a **** *******, and *********** that his new friend had not been followed by any *********** person. 

The two ******** back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the ********* **** that the Dodger was doing full justice to his ********-**, and ************ for himself a ******** **********. 





CHAPTER **** 

THE TIME ******* FOR NANCY TO ****** HER ****** TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE 



***** as she was, in all the **** of ******* and *************, the girl Nancy could not ****** ******* the effect which the ********* of the step she had taken, ******* upon her mind.  She ********** that both the ****** Jew and the ****** Sikes had ******** to her *******, which had been ****** from all others: in the full ********** that she was *********** and beyond the ***** of their *********.  **** as those ******* were, desperate as were their ***********, and ****** as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, ****** and ****** down into an ***** of ***** and misery, ****** was no ******; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some *********, **** her ********** should bring him within the iron ***** he had so long ******, and he should **** at ****--****** as he ******* such a ****--** her hand. 

But, these were the mere ********** of a mind ****** ****** to ****** itself from old companions and ************, though ******* to *** itself ******** on one object, and resolved not to be turned ***** by any consideration.  Her ***** for Sikes would have been more ******** *********** to ****** while there was yet time; but she had ********** that her secret should be ******* kept, she had dropped no **** which could **** to his *********, she had *******, even for his sake, a ****** from all the ***** and ************ that *********** ***--*** what more could she do! She was resolved. 

Though all her ****** ********* ********** in this **********, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their ****** too. She grew pale and ****, even within a few days.  At times, she took no **** of what was passing before her, or no part in ************* where once, she would have been the *******.  At other times, she laughed without *********, and was ***** without a moment **********--*** sat silent and ********, ******** with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more ******** than even these ***********, that she was ill at ****, and that her thoughts were ******** with matters very different and ******* from those in the course of ********** by her companions. 

It was ****** night, and the bell of the ******* church struck the hour.  Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.  The girl looked up from the low seat on which she ********, and listened too.  ******. 

'An hour this side of ********,' said Sikes, raising the ***** to look out and ********* to his seat.  'Dark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.' 

'Ah!' replied Fagin.  'What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there's none quite ready to be done.' 

'You're right for once,' replied Sikes *******.  'It is a pity, for I'm in the ****** too.' 

Fagin ******, and shook his head ************. 

'We must make up for lost time when **'** got things into a good *****. That's all I know,' said Sikes. 

'That's the way to talk, my dear,' replied Fagin, ********* to *** him on the shoulder.  'It does me good to hear you.' 

'Does you good, does it!' cried Sikes.  'Well, so be it.' 

'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed Fagin, as if he were ******** by even this **********.  'You're like yourself to-night, Bill.  Quite like 



'I don't feel like myself when you lay that ******** old **** on my shoulder, so take it away,' said Sikes, ******* off the Jew's hand. 

'It make you *******, ****,--******* you of being ******, does it?' said Fagin, determined not to be ********. 

'******* me of being ****** by the devil,' returned Sikes. 'There never was another man with such a face as *****, unless it was your father, and I suppose _he_ is ******** his ******** red ***** by this time, unless you came straight from the old '** without any father at all ******* you; which I *******'* wonder at, a bit.' 

Fagin ******* no reply to this **********:  but, ******* Sikes by the ******, pointed his ****** towards Nancy, who had taken ********* of the ********* conversation to put on her ******, and was now leaving the room. 

'*****!' cried Sikes.  '*****.  *****'* the *** going to at this time of night?' 

'Not far.' 

'What ******'* that?' retorted Sikes.  'Do you hear me?' 

'I don't know where,' replied the girl. 

'Then I do,' said Sikes, more in the ****** of ********* than because he had any real ********* to the girl going where she ******. '*******.  Sit down.' 

'I'm not well.  I told you that before,' rejoined the girl.  'I want a breath of air.' 

'Put your head out of the ******,' replied Sikes. 

'There's not enough there,' said the girl.  'I want it in the street.' 

'Then you won't have it,' replied Sikes.  With which ********* he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and ******* her ****** from her head, ***** it up to the top of an old *****.  'There,' said the robber.  'Now stop ******* where you are, will you?' 

'It's not such a matter as a ****** would keep me,' said the girl turning very pale.  'What do you mean, Bill?  Do you know what you're 



'Know what *'*--**!' cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her ******, you know, or she *****'* talk to me in that way.' 

'You'll ***** me on the something desperate,' muttered the girl ******* both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent ********.  'Let me go, will ***,--**** ******--**** instant.' 

'No!' said Sikes. 

'Tell him to let me go, Fagin.  He had better.  **'** be better for him.  Do you hear me?' cried Nancy ******** her foot upon the ground. 

'Hear you!' repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to ******** her. '***!  And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a **** on your throat **'** **** some of that ********* voice out. Wot has come over you, you ****!  Wot is it?' 

'Let me go,' said the girl with great ***********; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, 'Bill, let me go; you don't know what you are doing. You don't, indeed.  For only one 



'Cut my ***** off one by one!' cried Sikes, ******* her ******* by the arm, 'If I don't think the ***'* ***** ****** mad.  Get up.' 

'Not till you let me **--*** till you let me **--*****--*****!' ******** the girl.  Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly ********* her hands ******* her, ********** and ********* with him by the way, into a small room *********, where he sat himself on a *****, and ********* her into a chair, held her down by force.  She ********* and ******** by turns until ****** o'clock had struck, and then, ******* and *********, ****** to ******* the point any further.  With a *******, ****** by many *****, to make no more ******* to go out that night, Sikes left her to ******* at ******* and rejoined Fagin. 

'****!' said the ************ ****** the ************ from his face. 'Wot a ******** strange *** that is!' 

'You may say that, Bill,' replied Fagin ************.  'You may say 



'Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?' asked Sikes.  'Come; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?' 

'*********; *****'* *********, I suppose, my dear.' 

'Well, I suppose it is,' growled Sikes.  'I thought I had ***** her, but she's as bad as ever.' 

'Worse,' said Fagin ************.  'I never knew her like this, for such a little cause.' 

'Nor I,' said Sikes.  'I think she's got a ***** of that fever in her blood yet, and it won't come ***--**?' 

'Like enough.' 

'I'll let her a little blood, without ********* the doctor, if she's took that way again,' said Sikes. 

Fagin nodded an ********** ******** of this **** of *********. 

'She was ******* about me all day, and night too, when I was ********* on my back; and you, like a ************ **** as you are, kept yourself *****,' said Sikes.  'We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it's ******* and ******* her; and that being shut up here so long has made her ********--**?' 

'That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a whisper.  'Hush!' 

As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat.  Her eyes were ******* and red; she ****** herself to and fro; ****** her head; and, after a little time, burst out ********. 

'Why, now she's on the other ****!' exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of ********* surprise on his companion. 

Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl ******** into her ********** *********. ********** Sikes that there was no fear of her *********, Fagin took up his hat and **** him ****-*****.  He paused when he reached the ****-****, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs. 

'Light him down,' said Sikes, who was ******* his ****. 'It's a pity he should ***** his neck himself, and ********** the *****-*****.  Show him a light.' 

Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.  When they reached the passage, he laid his ****** on his ***, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. 

'What is it, Nancy, dear?' 

'What do you mean?' replied the girl, in the same tone. 

'The reason of all this,' replied Fagin.  'If _**_'--** pointed with his ****** ****-****** up the ******--'** so hard with you (he's a *****, *****, a *****-*****), why don't you--' 

'Well?' said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost ******** her ear, and his eyes looking into ****. 

'No matter just now.  We'll talk of this again.  You have a friend in me, *****; a ******* friend.  I have the means at hand, quiet and close.  If you want ******* on those that ***** you like a ***--**** a dog!  worse than his dog, for he ******* him *********--**** to me.  I say, come to me.  He is the mere ***** of a day, but you know me of old, *****.' 

'I know you well,' replied the girl, without *********** the least *******.  '****-*****.' 

She ****** back, as Fagin ******* to lay his hand on ****, but said ****-***** again, in a ****** voice, and, ********* his ******* look with a *** of intelligence, closed the door between them. 

Fagin walked towards his home, ****** upon the thoughts that were ******* within his *****.  He had ********* the ****--*** from what had just passed though that had ****** to ******* him, but slowly and by *******--**** Nancy, ******* of the ************'* *********, had ********* an ********** for some new friend.  Her ******* manner, her repeated ******** from home alone, her *********** ************ to the ********* of the **** for which she had once been so *******, and, added to these, her desperate ********** to leave home that night at a particular hour, all ******** the ***********, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of *********.  The object of this new ****** was not among his *********.  He would be a ******** *********** with such an ********* as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin ******) be ******* without *****. 

There was another, and a ****** object, to be ******.  Sikes knew too much, and his ******* ****** had not ****** Fagin the less, because the ****** were ******.  The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his ****, and that it would be ****** *******--** the ******* of *****, or perhaps the loss of ****--** the object of her more ****** *****. 

'With a little **********,' thought Fagin, 'what more ****** than that she would ******* to ****** him?  Women have done such things, and worse, to ****** the same object before now.  There would be the ********* *******:  the man I ****:  gone; another ******* in his place; and my ********* over the girl, with a ********* of this ***** to back it, *********.' 

These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the ************'* room; and with them ********* in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards ******** him, of ******** the girl in the broken ***** he threw out at *******.  There was no expression of surprise, no ********** of an ********* to understand his *******.  The girl ******* ************ it.  Her glance at ******* showed _that_. 

But perhaps she would ****** from a **** to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the ***** **** to be ********. 'How,' thought Fagin, as he crept ********, 'can I ******** my ********* with her?  What new power can I *******?' 

Such ****** are ******* in **********.  If, without ********** a ********** from herself, he laid a watch, ********** the object of her ******* ******, and ********** to ****** the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his *******, could he not ****** her **********? 

'I can,' said Fagin, almost *****.  'She ***** not ****** me then.  Not for her life, not for her life!  I have it all.  The means are ready, and shall be set to work.  I shall have you yet!' 

He cast back a dark look, and a *********** ****** of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the ****** *******; and went on his way: ******* his **** hands in the ***** of his ******** *******, which he ******** ******* in his *****, as though there were a ***** ***** ******* with every ****** of his *******. 





CHAPTER *** 

NOAH CLAYPOLE IS ******** BY FAGIN ON A SECRET ******* 

The old man was up, *******, next morning, and ****** impatiently for the appearance of his new *********, who after a ***** that seemed ************, at length presented himself, and ********* a ********* ******* on the *********. 

'Bolter,' said Fagin, drawing up a chair and ******* himself opposite ****** Bolter. 

'Well, here I am,' returned Noah.  'What's the matter?  Don't yer ask me to do anything till I have done ******. That's a great ***** in this place.  Yer never get time enough over yer *****.' 

'You can talk as you eat, can't you?' said Fagin, ******* his dear young friend's ********** from the very ****** of his heart. 

'Oh yes, I can talk.  I get on better when I talk,' said Noah, ******* a ********* ***** of bread.  '*****'* Charlotte?' 

'Out,' said Fagin.  'I sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.' 

'Oh!' said Noah.  'I wish ***'* ******* her to make some ******** ***** first.  Well.  Talk away.  Yer won't ********* me.' 

There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything ************ him, as he had ********* sat down with a ************* to do a great deal of 



'You did well *********, my dear,' said Fagin.  'Beautiful!  Six ********* and ********* ********* on the very first day!  The ******* lay will be a ******* to you.' 

'Don't you ****** to *** three ****-**** and a ****-***,' said Mr. 



'No, no, my dear.  The ****-**** were great ******* of ******: but the ****-*** was a ******* ***********.' 

'Pretty well, I think, for a ********,' ******** Mr. Bolter ************.  'The **** I took off **** ********, and the ****-*** was standing by itself outside a public-house.  I thought it might get ***** with the rain, or ***** cold, yer know.  Eh?  Ha! ha! ha!' 

Fagin ******** to laugh very ********; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a ****** of large *****, which ******** his first **** of bread and ******, and ******** himself to a second. 

'I want you, Bolter,' said Fagin, ******* over the table, 'to do a piece of work for me, my dear, that ***** great care and *******.' 

'I say,' rejoined Bolter, 'don't yer go ******* me into danger, or ******* me any more *' yer ******-*******. That don't suit me, that don't; and so I tell yer.' 

'That's not the ******** danger in **--*** the very ********,' said the Jew; 'it's only to ***** a woman.' 

'An old woman?' demanded Mr. Bolter. 

'A young one,' replied Fagin. 

'I can do that pretty well, I know,' said Bolter.  'I was a ******* ******* ***** when I was at ******.  What am I to ***** her for?  Not 



'Not to do anything, but to tell me where she ****, who she ****, and, if possible, what she says; to ******** the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the *********** you can.' 

'****'** yer give me?' asked Noah, ******* down his ***, and looking his ********, eagerly, in the face. 

'If you do it well, a pound, my dear.  One pound,' said Fagin, ******* to interest him in the ***** as much as possible.  'And that's what I never gave yet, for any *** of work where there wasn't ******** consideration to be ******.' 

'Who is she?' inquired Noah. 

'One of us.' 

'Oh ***!' cried Noah, ******* up his nose.  'Yer ******** of her, are 



'She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,' replied Fagin. 

'I see,' said Noah.  'Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they're *********** people, eh?  Ha! ha! ha! I'm your man.' 

'I knew you would be,' cried Fagin, ****** by the ******* of his 



'Of course, of course,' replied Noah.  'Where is she? Where am I to **** for her?  Where am I to go?' 

'All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.  I'll point her out at the ****** time,' said Fagin.  'You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.' 

That night, and the next, and the next again, the *** sat ****** and ******** in his ******'* *****:  ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.  Six ****** ******--*** long ***** ******--*** on each, Fagin came home with a ************ face, and ******* ********* that it was not yet time.  On the *******, he returned *******, and with an ********** he could not *******.  It was ******. 

'She **** ****** to-night,' said Fagin, 'and on the right ******, I'm sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before ********.  Come with me. Quick!' 

Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such ******* ********** that it ******** him.  They left the house **********, and ******** through a ********* of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah ********** as the same in which he had *****, on the night of his ******* in London. 

It was past ****** o'clock, and the door was closed.  It opened softly on its ****** as Fagin gave a low *******. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them. 

Scarcely ********* to whisper, but ************ **** show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had ******** them, pointed out the **** of glass to Noah, and ****** to him to ***** up and ******* the person in the ********* room. 

'Is that the woman?' he asked, scarcely above his breath. 

Fagin nodded yes. 

'I can't see her face well,' whispered Noah.  'She is looking down, and the candle is behind her. 

'**** there,' whispered Fagin.  He ****** to Barney, who ********.  In an instant, the lad entered the room *********, and, under ******** of ******** the candle, moved it in the ******** position, and, speaking to the girl, ****** her to ***** her face. 

'I see her now,' cried the ***. 





'I should know her among a ********.' 

He hastily *********, as the ****-**** opened, and the girl came out. Fagin drew him behind a small ********* which was ********* off, and they held their ******* as she passed within a few feet of their place of ***********, and ******* by the door at which they had entered. 

'****!' cried the lad who held the door.  '***.' 

Noah ********* a look with Fagin, and ****** out. 

'To the left,' whispered the lad; 'take the left had, and keep ** the other side.' 

He did so; and, by the light of the *****, saw the ****'* ********** ******, already at some distance before him.  He ******** as near as he considered *******, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to ******* her *******. She looked ********* round, twice or ******, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, **** on.  She seemed to ****** ******* as she ********, and to walk with a ******** and ****** step.  The *** ********* the same ******** distance between them, and followed:  with his eye upon her. 





CHAPTER **** 

THE *********** KEPT 

The church ****** ****** three ******** past ******, as two ******* ******* on London Bridge.  One, which ******** with a ***** and ***** step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in ***** of some expected object; the other ****** was that of a man, who ***** along in the ******* ****** he could find, and, at some distance, ************ his pace to ****:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she moved again, ******** ********** on:  but never ******** himself, in the ****** of his *******, to **** upon her *********.  Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the ********* to the ****** *****, when the woman, apparently ************ in her anxious ******** of the ****-**********, turned back.  The ******** was sudden; but he who watched her, was not ****** off his ***** by it; for, ********* into one of the ******** which ******** the ***** of the bridge, and ******* over the ******* the better to ******* his ******, he ******** her to **** on the opposite ********. When she was about the same distance in ******* as she had been before, he ******* ******* down, and followed her again. At nearly the ****** of the bridge, she stopped.  The man stopped too. 

It was a very dark night.  The day had been ************, and at that hour and place there were few people ********. Such as there were, hurried quickly past:  very ******** without seeing, but certainly without ********, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not ********** to ******* the *********** ******* of such of ******'* ********* **********, as ******* to take their way over the bridge that night in ****** of some cold **** or ******** ***** ******* to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:  neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed. 

A **** hung over the *****, ********* the red ***** of the ***** that ***** upon the small ***** ****** off the different ******, and ********* ****** and more ********** the ***** ********* on the *****. The old *****-******* *********** on either side, rose heavy and **** from the ***** **** of ***** and ******, and ******* ******* upon water too black to ******* even their ********* ******. The ***** of old ***** *******'* Church, and the ***** of ***** ******, so long the *****-******* of the ******* bridge, were ******* in the *****; but the ****** of ******** below bridge, and the ******* ********* ****** of ******** above, were nearly all ****** from sight. 

The girl had taken a few ******** turns to and ***--******* watched meanwhile by her ****** ********--**** the heavy bell of **. ****'* ****** for the death of another day.  ******** had come upon the crowded ****.  The ******, the *****-******, the ****, the ********: the ******** of birth and death, of ****** and ********, the ***** face of the ****** and the **** sleep of the child:  ******** was upon them 



The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a ****-****** gentleman, ******** from a *******-******** within a short distance of the bridge, and, having ********* the *******, walked straight towards it.  They had scarcely set foot upon its ********, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them. 

They walked ******, looking about them with the air of ******* who *********** some very slight *********** which had little ****** of being ********, when they were suddenly ****** by this new *********. They ****** with an *********** of surprise, but ********** it immediately; for a man in the ******** of a ********** came close **--******* against them, ******--** that ******* moment. 

'Not here,' said Nancy *********, 'I am afraid to speak to you here. Come ****--*** of the public ****--**** the steps ******!' 

As she uttered these words, and *********, with her hand, the direction in which she ****** them to *******, the ********** looked round, and ******* ****** what they took up the whole ******** for, passed on. 

The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the ****** ****, and on the same side of the bridge as ***** *******'* Church, form a *******-****** from the *****.  To this spot, the man ******* the appearance of a **********, ******** **********; and after a moment's ****** of the place, he began to *******. 

These stairs are a part of the bridge; they ******* of three *******. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left ********** in an ********** ******** ****** towards the ******. At this point the lower steps *****:  so that a person turning that ***** of the wall, is *********** ****** by any others on the stairs who ****** to be above him, if only a step. The ********** looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of ***********, and, the **** being out, there was ****** of room, he ******* *****, with his back to the ********, and there ******:  pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with 



So ******* ***** the time in this ****** place, and so ***** was the *** to ********* the ******* of an ********* so different from what he had been led to ******, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and ********* himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had ******** to some ******** different spot to hold their ********** conversation.  He was on the point of ******** from his ******-*****, and ********* the road above, when he heard the sound of *********, and directly afterwards of ****** almost close at his ear. 

He drew himself straight ******* against the wall, and, scarcely *********, listened ***********. 

'This is far enough,' said a voice, which was ********* that of the gentleman.  'I will not ****** the young lady to go any *******.  Many people would have ********** you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am ******* to ****** you.' 

'To ****** me!' cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. 'You're ***********, indeed, sir.  To ****** me!  Well, well, it's no 



'Why, for what,' said the gentleman in a ****** tone, 'for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place?  Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something ********, ******* of ******** us to this dark and ****** ****?' 

'I told you before,' replied Nancy, 'that I was afraid to speak to you there.  I don't know why it is,' said the girl, **********, 'but I have such a fear and ***** upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.' 

'A fear of what?' asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her. 

'I scarcely know of what,' replied the girl.  'I wish I did. ******** thoughts of death, and ******* with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me **** as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.  I was ******* a book to-night, to **** the time away, and the same things came into the *****.' 

'***********,' said the gentleman, ******** her. 

'No ***********,' replied the girl in a ****** voice. 'I'll ***** I saw "coffin" ******* in every **** of the book in large black *******,--***, and they carried one close to me, in the streets 



'There is nothing ******* in that,' said the gentleman. 'They have passed me often.' 

'_Real ****_,' rejoined the girl.  'This was not.' 

There was something so ******** in her manner, that the ***** of the ********* ******** crept as he heard the girl ***** these words, and the blood ******* within him.  He had never *********** a ******* ****** than in ******* the sweet voice of the young lady as she ****** her to be ****, and not ***** herself to become the **** of such ******* *******. 

'Speak to her ******,' said the young lady to her companion. 'Poor creature!  She ***** to need it.' 

'Your ******* ********* people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and ******** of ****** and *********,' cried the girl.  'Oh, dear lady, why **'*'* those who ***** to be ***'* own ***** as gentle and as kind to us poor ******** as you, who, having *****, and ******, and all that they have lost, might be a little ***** ******* of so much *******?' 

'Ah!' said the gentleman.  'A **** turns his face, after ******* it well, to the ****, when he says his *******; these good people, after giving their faces such a *** against the World as to take the ****** off, turn with no less **********, to the ******* side of Heaven. Between the ********* and the ********, ******* me to the first!' 

These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of ********* Nancy time to ******* herself.  The gentleman, ******* afterwards, addressed himself to her. 

'You were not here last ****** night,' he said. 

'I couldn't come,' replied Nancy; 'I was kept by force.' 

'By whom?' 

'Him that I told the young lady of before.' 

'You were not ********* of ******* any ************* with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?' asked the old 



'No,' replied the girl, shaking her head.  'It's not very **** for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn't give him a drink of ******** before I came away.' 

'Did he ***** before you returned?' inquired the gentleman. 

'No; and neither he nor any of them ******* me.' 

'Good,' said the gentleman.  'Now listen to me.' 

'I am ready,' replied the girl, as he paused for a moment. 

'This young lady,' the gentleman began, 'has ************ to me, and to some other friends who can be ****** *******, what you told her nearly a ********* since.  I ******* to you that I had ******, at first, whether you were to be ********** ****** upon, but now I firmly believe you are.' 

'I am,' said the girl *********. 

'I ****** that I firmly believe it.  To ***** to you that I am disposed to ***** you, I tell you without *******, that we ******* to ****** the secret, ******** it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.  But **--**--' said the gentleman, 'he cannot be *******, or, if *******, cannot be ***** upon as we wish, you must ******* up the Jew.' 

'Fagin,' cried the girl, *********. 

'That man must be ********* up by you,' said the gentleman. 

'I will not do it!  I will never do it!' replied the girl. 'Devil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.' 

'You will not?' said the gentleman, who seemed ***** ******** for this 



'Never!' returned the girl. 

'Tell me why?' 

'For one reason,' rejoined the girl firmly, 'for one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same ******* together, and I'll not turn upon them, who *****--*** of ****--**** turned upon me, but didn't, bad as they are.' 

'Then,' said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been ****** to ******; 'put Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.' 

'What if he turns against the others?' 

'I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's little history which it would be ******* to **** before the public eye, and if the truth is once ********, they shall go **** free.' 

'And if it is not?' ********* the girl. 

'Then,' pursued the gentleman, 'this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your *******.  In such a case I could show you *******, I think, which would ****** you to ***** it.' 

'Have I the ****'* promise for that?' asked the girl. 

'You have,' replied Rose.  'My true and ******** ******.' 

'Monks would never ***** how you knew what you do?' said the girl, after a short *****. 

'Never,' replied the gentleman.  'The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even *****.' 

'I have been a ****, and among ***** from a little child,' said the girl after another ******** of silence, 'but I will take your words.' 

After ********* an ********* from both, that she might ****** do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often ********* for the ******** to ******** even the ******* of what she said, to ********, by name and *********, the public-house ****** she had been followed that night.  From the manner in which she ************ paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some ***** ***** of the *********** she ************.  When she had ********** ********* the ********** of the place, the best position from which to watch it without ******** ***********, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the ***** of *********** it, she seemed to ******** for a few moments, for the purpose of ********* his features and *********** more ******** to her ************. 

'He is ****,' said the girl, 'and a ******** made man, but not *****; he has a ******* walk; and as he *****, ********** looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don't ****** that, for his eyes are **** in his head so much ****** than any other man's, that you might almost tell him by that alone.  His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can't be more than six or ***** and twenty, ******** and *******. His lips are often *********** and ********** with the ***** of teeth; for he has desperate ****, and sometimes even ***** his hands and ****** them with ******--*** did you *****?' said the girl, stopping suddenly. 

The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not ********* of having done so, and ****** her to *******. 

'Part of this,' said the girl, 'I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large *****.  I think that's all I can give you to know him by.  **** though,' she added.  'Upon his throat:  so high that you can see a part of it below his *********** when he turns his face:  there is--' 

'A ***** red ****, like a **** or *****?' cried the gentleman. 

'***'* this?' said the girl.  'You know him!' 

The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the ******** could ********** hear them *******. 

'I think I do,' said the gentleman, ******** silence.  'I should by your ***********.  We shall see.  Many people are ********** like each other.  It may not be the same.' 

As he ********* himself to this effect, with ******* ************, he took a step or two ****** the ********* ***, as the latter could tell from the ************ with which he heard him ******, 'It must be he!' 

'Now,' he said, *********:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot where he had stood before, 'you have given us most ******** **********, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to ***** you?' 

'Nothing,' replied Nancy. 

'You will not ******* in saying that,' rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and ******** of ******** that might have ******* a much ****** and more ******** heart. 'Think now.  Tell me.' 

'Nothing, sir,' rejoined the girl, *******.  'You can do nothing to help me.  I am past all hope, indeed.' 

'You put yourself beyond its pale,' said the gentleman. 'The past has been a ****** ***** with you, of ******** ******** ***-*****, and such ********* ********* ********, as the ******* ******* but once and never ****** again, but, for the ******, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to ***** you ***** of heart and mind, for that must come as you **** it; but a quiet ******, either in *******, or, if you fear to ****** here, in some ******* country, it is not only within the ******* of our ******* but our most anxious wish to ****** you. Before the **** of morning, before this ***** ***** to the first ******* of ***-*****, you shall be placed as ******** beyond the ***** of your former **********, and leave as ***** an ******* of all ***** behind you, as if you were to ********* from the earth this moment.  Come!  I would not have you go back to ******** one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old *****, or ******* the very air which is ********** and death to you.  **** them all, while there is time and 



'She will be ********* now,' cried the young lady.  'She *********, I am sure.' 

'I fear not, my dear,' said the gentleman. 

'No sir, I do not,' replied the girl, after a short ********.  'I am ******* to my old life.  I ****** and **** it now, but I cannot leave it.  I must have gone too far to turn ****,--*** yet I don't know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.  But,' she said, looking hastily round, 'this fear comes over me again.  I must go home.' 

'Home!' repeated the young lady, with great ****** upon the word. 

'Home, lady,' rejoined the girl.  'To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life.  Let us part. I shall be watched or seen.  Go!  Go!  If I have done you any ******* all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.' 

'It is *******,' said the gentleman, with a ****.  'We ********** her ******, perhaps, by ******* here.  We may have ******** her longer than she expected already.' 

'Yes, yes,' ***** the girl. 'You have.' 

'What,' cried the young lady, 'can be the end of this poor ********'* 



'What!' repeated the girl.  'Look before you, lady.  Look at that dark water.  How many times do you read of such as I who ****** into the ****, and leave no living thing, to care for, or ****** them.  It may be years *****, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at 



'Do not speak thus, pray,' returned the young lady, *******. 

'It will never ***** your ears, dear lady, and God ****** such ******* should!' replied the girl.  '****-*****, ****-*****!' 

The gentleman turned away. 

'This *****,' cried the young lady.  'Take it for my sake, that you may have some ******** in an hour of need and trouble.' 

'No!' replied the girl.  'I have not done this for money.  Let me have that to think of.  And ***--**** me something that you have ****:  I should like to have *********--**, no, not a ****--**** ****** or ************--******** that I can keep, as having ******** to you, sweet lady.  There.  Bless you!  God bless you. ****-*****, ****-*****!' 

The violent ********* of the girl, and the ************ of some ********* which would subject her to ***-***** and violence, seemed to ********* the gentleman to leave her, as she *********. 

The sound of ********** ********* were ******* and the ****** ******. 

The two ******* of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge.  They stopped at the ****** of the stairs. 

'****!' cried the young lady, *********.  'Did she call!  I thought I heard her voice.' 

'No, my love,' replied Mr. Brownlow, looking ***** back. 'She has not moved, and will not till we are gone.' 

Rose Maylie ********, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away.  As they ***********, the girl **** down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and ****** the ******* of her heart in ****** tears. 

After a time she *****, and with ****** and ********* steps ******** the street.  The ********** ******** remained ********** on his **** for some minutes afterwards, and having ***********, with many ******** ******* round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his ******-*****, and returned, ********** and in the ***** of the wall, in the same manner as he had *********. 

******* out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was **********, Noah Claypole ****** away at his ****** *****, and made for the Jew's house as fast as his legs would carry him.

It was nearly two hours before ***-*****; that time which in the ****** of the year, may be ***** called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and ********; when even ****** ****** to *******, and ********** and **** have ********* home to *****; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old ****, with face so ********* and pale, and eyes so red and *****-****, that he looked less like a man, than like some ******* *******, ***** from the grave, and ******* by an **** ******. 

He sat ********* over a cold ******, ******* in an old **** ********, with his face turned towards a ******* candle that stood upon a table by his side.  His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, ******** in thought, he *** his long black *****, he ********* among his ********* **** a few such ***** as should have been a dog's or ***'*. 

********* upon a ******** on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast ******. Towards him the old man sometimes ******** his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a ****-***** **** ******** almost ******, and *** ****** falling down in ***** upon the table, ******* showed that his thoughts were **** *********. 

Indeed they were.  ************* at the ********* of his ******* ******; ****** of the girl who had ***** to ****** with *********; and ***** ******** of the ********* of her ******* to ***** him up; ****** ************** at the loss of his ******* on Sikes; the fear of *********, and ****, and death; and a ****** and ****** **** ******* by all; these were the ********** ************** which, following close upon each other with ***** and ********* *****, **** through the ***** of Fagin, as every **** thought and ******** purpose lay ******* at his 



He sat without ******** his attitude in the least, or ********* to take the ******** **** of time, until his quick ear seemed to be ********* by a ******** in the street. 

'At last,' he muttered, ****** his *** and ******* mouth. 'At last!' 

The bell **** gently as he spoke.  He crept upstairs to the door, and ********* returned accompanied by a man ******* to the ****, who carried a ****** under one arm. Sitting down and ******** back his ***** coat, the man ********* the ***** ***** of Sikes. 

'There!' he said, laying the ****** on the table.  'Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.  It's been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.' 

Fagin laid his hand upon the ******, and ******* it in the ********, sat down again without speaking.  But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked ******* at him, with his lips ********* so *********, and his face so ******* by the ******** which had ******** him, that the ************ ************* drew back his chair, and ******** him with a look of real ********. 

'Wot now?' cried Sikes.  'Wot do you look at a man so for?' 

Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling ********** in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of ****** was for the moment gone. 

'*****!' said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. 'He's gone mad.  I must look to myself here.' 

'No, no,' rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.  'It's ***--***'** not the person, Bill.  I've **--** ***** to find with you.' 

'Oh, you haven't, haven't you?' said Sikes, looking ******* at him, and ************** passing a ****** into a more ********** pocket.  'That's *****--*** one of us.  Which one that is, don't matter.' 

'I've got that to tell you, Bill,' said Fagin, drawing his chair ******, 'will make you worse than me.' 

'***?' returned the robber with an *********** air.  'Tell away! Look sharp, or ***** will think I'm lost.' 

'Lost!' cried Fagin.  'She has pretty well ******* that, in her own mind, already.' 

Sikes looked with an ****** of great ********** into the Jew's face, and ******* no ************ *********** of the ****** there, ******** his coat ****** in his **** hand and shook him *******. 

'Speak, will you!' he said; 'or if you don't, it shall be for want of breath.  Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in ***** words. Out with it, you ********** old ***, out with it!' 

'Suppose that lad that's laying there--' Fagin began. 

Sikes turned round to where Noah was ********, as if he had not ********** observed him.  'Well!' he said, ******** his former position. 

'Suppose that lad,' pursued Fagin, 'was to *****--** blow upon us ***--***** ******* out the right ***** for the purpose, and then having a ******* with 'em in the street to ***** our **********, ******** every **** that they might know us by, and the **** where we might be most ****** taken.  Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a ***** **'** all been in, more or ****--** his own *****; not *******, *******, tried, ********* by the ****** and brought to it on bread and *****,--*** of his own *****; to please his own *****; ******** out at ****** to find those most ********** against us, and ******** to them.  Do you hear me?' cried the Jew, his eyes ******** with ****.  'Suppose he did all this, what then?' 

'What then!' replied Sikes; with a ********** ****.  'If he was left alive till I came, I'd ***** his ***** under the iron **** of my **** into as many ****** as there are ***** upon his head.' 

'What if I did it!' cried Fagin almost in a ****.  'I, that knows so much, and could **** so many besides myself!' 

'I don't know,' replied Sikes, ********* his teeth and turning white at the mere **********.  'I'd do something in the **** that '** get me put in *****; and if I was tried along with you, I'd **** upon you with them in the open *****, and beat your ****** out afore the people. I should have such strength,' muttered the robber, ******* his ****** arm, 'that I could ***** your head as if a ****** ****** had gone over 



'You would?' 

'Would I!' said the ************.  '*** me.' 

'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or ***, or--' 

'I don't care who,' replied Sikes impatiently.  '******* it was, I'd ***** them the same.' 

Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, ********* him to be silent, ******* over the bed upon the floor, and shook the ******* to ***** him.  Sikes ***** forward in his chair:  looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if ********* much what all this *********** and *********** was to end in. 

'Bolter, Bolter!  Poor lad!' said Fagin, looking up with an expression of ******** ************, and speaking slowly and with ****** ********. 'He's *****--***** with watching for her so ****,--******** for _her_, 



'Wot *'** mean?' asked Sikes, drawing back. 

Fagin made no answer, but ******* over the ******* again, ****** him into a sitting *******.  When his ******* name had been repeated several times, Noah ****** his eyes, and, giving a heavy ****, looked ******** about him. 

'Tell me that *****--**** again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke. 

'Tell yer what?' asked the ****** Noah, shaking himself *********. 

'That about-- _Nancy_,' said Fagin, ********* Sikes by the *****, as if to ******* his leaving the house before he had heard enough. 'You followed her?' 





'To London Bridge?' 





'Where she *** two people.' 

'So she did.' 

'A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own ****** before, who asked her to give up all her ****, and Monks first, which she ***--*** to ******** him, which she ***--*** to tell her what house it was that we **** at, and go to, which she ***--*** where it could be best watched from, which she ***--*** what time the people went there, which she did.  She did all this.  She told it all every word without a ******, without a ******--*** ***--*** she not?' cried Fagin, half mad with ****. 

'All right,' replied Noah, ********** his head.  'That's just what it 



'What did they say, about last ******?' 

'About last ******!' replied Noah, ***********.  'Why I told yer that 



'Again.  Tell it again!' cried Fagin, ********** his ***** on Sikes, and *********** his other hand *****, as the **** **** from his lips. 

'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he grew more *******, seemed to have a ******* ********** who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't come, last ******, as she ********.  She said she couldn't.' 

'***--***?  Tell him that.' 

'Because she was ******** kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,' replied Noah. 

'What more of him?' cried Fagin.  'What more of the man she had told them of before?  Tell him that, tell him that.' 

'Why, that she couldn't very ****** get out of ***** unless he knew where she was going to,' said Noah; 'and so the first time she went to see the lady, ***--**! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it ***--*** gave him a drink of ********.' 

'****'* fire!' cried Sikes, ******** ******** from the Jew.  'Let me 



******** the old man from him, he ****** from the room, and ******, ****** and *********, up the stairs. 

'Bill, Bill!' cried Fagin, following him hastily.  'A word. Only a 



The word would not have been *********, but that the ************ was ****** to open the door:  on which he was ********* ********* ***** and violence, when the Jew came ******* up. 

'Let me out,' said Sikes.  'Don't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me out, I say!' 

'Hear me speak a word,' rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the ****. 'You won't be--' 

'Well,' replied the other. 

'You won't **--***--*******, Bill?' 

The day was ********, and there was light enough for the men to see each other's faces.  They ********* one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be ********. 

'I mean,' said Fagin, ******* that he felt all ******** was now *******, 'not too violent for ******.  Be ******, Bill, and not too 



Sikes made no reply; but, ******* open the door, of which Fagin had turned the ****, ****** into the silent streets. 

Without one *****, or moment's consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the ***, or ******** them to the ground, but looking straight before him with ****** **********:  his teeth so ******* ********** that the ******** *** seemed starting through his ****; the robber held on his ******** course, nor muttered a word, nor ******* a ******, until he reached his own door.  He opened it, softly, with a key; ****** ******* up the stairs; and ******** his own room, ******-****** the door, and ******* a heavy table against it, drew back the ******* of the bed. 

The girl was lying, ****-*******, upon it.  He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and ******** look. 

'Get up!' said the man. 

'It is you, Bill!' said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his 



'It is,' was the reply.  'Get up.' 

There was a candle *******, but the man hastily drew it from the ***********, and ****** it under the *****.  Seeing the ***** light of early day without, the girl rose to ****** the *******. 

'Let it be,' said Sikes, ********* his hand before her. 'There's enough light for wot I've got to do.' 

'Bill,' said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, 'why do you look like that at me!' 

The robber sat ********* her, for a few *******, with ******* ******** and ******* breast; and then, ******** her by the head and throat, ******* her into the ****** of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth. 

'Bill, Bill!' ****** the girl, ********* with the strength of ****** ****,--'*--* won't ****** or ***--*** ****--**** **--***** to **--**** me what I have done!' 

'You know, you she devil!' returned the robber, *********** his breath. 'You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.' 

'Then ***** my life for the love of Heaven, as I ****** *****,' rejoined the girl, ******** to him.  'Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to **** me.  Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.  You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this *****; I will not ***** my hold, you cannot ***** me off.  Bill, Bill, for dear ***'* sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you ***** my blood!  I have been true to you, upon my ****** soul I have!' 

The man ********* *********, to ******* his arms; but those of the girl were ******* round his, and **** her as he would, he could not **** them away. 

'Bill,' cried the girl, ******** to lay her head upon his breast, 'the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some ******* country where I could end my days in ******** and *****.  Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far ***** **** better *****, and ****** how we have *****, except in *******, and never see each other more. It is never too late to ******. They told me **--* feel it ***--*** we must have ****--* little, little 



The ************ ***** one arm, and ******* his ******. The ********* of ********* ********* if he *****, ******* across his mind even in the ***** of his ****; and he beat it twice with all the force he could ******, upon the ******** face that almost ******* his own. 

She ********* and fell:  nearly ******* with the blood that ****** down from a deep **** in her ********; but raising herself, with **********, on her knees, drew from her ***** a white ************--**** ******'* ***--*** ******* it up, in her ****** hands, as high towards Heaven as her ****** strength would *****, ******** one ****** for mercy to her 



It was a ******* ****** to look upon.  The ******** ********** ******** to the wall, and ******** out the sight with his hand, ****** a heavy **** and struck her down. 





CHAPTER ****** 

THE ****** OF SIKES 

Of all bad ***** that, under ***** of the darkness, had been ********* within **** ******'* ****** since night hung over it, that was the *****.  Of all the ******* that rose with an ill ***** upon the morning air, that was the ******* and most *****. 

The ***--*** bright ***, that ****** back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and ********* to ***--***** upon the crowded **** in clear and ******* *****.  Through ******-******** glass and *****-****** window, through ********* **** and ****** *******, it **** its ***** ***.  It ******* up the room where the ******** woman lay. It did.  He tried to shut it out, but it would ****** in.  If the sight had been a ******* one in the **** morning, what was it, now, in all that ********* light! 

He had not moved; he had been afraid to ****.  There had been a **** and ****** of the hand; and, with ****** added to ****, he had struck and struck again.  Once he threw a *** over it; but it was worse to ***** the eyes, and ******* them ****** towards him, than to see them ******* ******, as if watching the ********** of the **** of **** that ******** and ****** in the ******** on the *******.  He had ******* it off again.  And there was the ****--**** ***** and blood, no ****--*** such *****, and so much blood! 

He struck a light, ******* a fire, and thrust the **** into it. There was hair upon the end, which ****** and ****** into a light ******, and, caught by the air, ******* up the *******.  Even that frightened him, ****** as he was; but he held the ****** till it *****, and then ***** it on the ***** to **** away, and ******** into *****.  He ****** himself, and ****** his clothes; there were ***** that would not be *******, but he cut the ****** out, and ***** them.  How those ****** were ********* about the room!  The very feet of the dog were ******. 

All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the ******; no, not for a moment.  Such ************ *********, he moved, ********, towards the door:  ******** the dog with him, **** he should **** his feet **** and carry out new ******** of the ***** into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house. 

He crossed over, and ******* up at the window, to be sure that nothing was ******* from the outside.  There was the ******* still drawn, which she would have opened to ***** the light she never saw again.  It lay nearly under there.  _He_ knew that.  God, how the *** ****** down upon the very spot! 

The glance was *************.  It was a ****** to have got free of the room.  He ******** on the dog, and walked ******* away. 

He went through *********; ****** up the hill at ******** on which ****** the stone in honour of ***********; turned down to ******** Hill, ******** of purpose, and ********* where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to ******* it; and taking the ****-**** across the fields, ******* **** ****, and so came on ********* *****.  ********** the ****** by the **** of *****, he ******* the opposite ****, and ******** the road which ***** the ******** of ********* and ********, made along the ********* ******* of the ***** to the fields at ***** End, in one of which he laid himself down under a *****, and *****. 

Soon he was up again, and ****,--*** far into the country, but back towards London by the ****-****--**** back *****--**** over another part of the same ground as he already *********--**** ********* up and down in fields, and lying on *******' ****** to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ****** on again. 

Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some **** and drink?  ******.  That was a good place, not far off, and out of most ******'* way.  ******* he ******** his *****,--******* sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange **********, ********* at a *****'* pace, or stopping ********** and **** ******** the ****** with a stick.  But when he got there, all the people he ***--*** very children at the *****--****** to view him with *********.  Back he turned again, without the ******* to ******** bit or drop, though he had ****** no **** for many hours; and once more he ******** on the *****, ********* where to go. 

He ******** over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place.  Morning and **** had passed, and the day was on the ****, and still he ******* to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still ******** about the same spot.  At last he got away, and ****** his course for ********. 

It was **** o'clock at night, when the man, quite ***** out, and the dog, ******* and **** from the ************ ********, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet *******, and ******** along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose ****** light had ****** them to the spot.  There was a fire in the ***-****, and some *******-********* were ******** before it. 

They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the ******** corner, and *** and ***** alone, or rather with his dog:  to whom he cast a ****** of **** from time to time. 

The conversation of the men ********* here, turned upon the ************ ****, and *******; and when those ****** were *********, upon the age of some old man who had been ****** on the previous ******; the young men present *********** him very old, and the old men present ********* him to have been quite *****--*** *****, one *****-****** *********** said, than he ***--**** ten or ******* year of life in him at *****--** he had taken care; if he had taken care. 

There was nothing to ******* attention, or ****** alarm in this. The robber, after ****** his *********, sat silent and ********* in his corner, and had almost dropped ******, when he was half ******* by the ***** ******** of a new *****. 

This was an ***** fellow, half ****** and half **********, who ********* about the country on foot to **** *****, ******, ******, *********, *******-*****, ******** for dogs and ******, ***** *********, *********, and ****-**** *****, which he carried in a case ***** to his back.  His ******** was the ****** for various ****** ***** with the **********, which ********* not until he had made his ******, and opened his box of *********, when he *********** ********* to ***** business with *********. 

'And what be that *****?  Good to eat, Harry?' asked a ******** **********, pointing to some ***********-***** in one corner. 

'This,' said the fellow, ********* one, 'this is the ********** and ********** *********** for ******** all ***** of *****, ****, ****, ******, *****, *****, spot, or *******, from ****, *****, *****, *******, *****, *****, *****, ******, ******, ******, *********, or ******* *****.  ****-******, *****-******, ****-******, *****-******, *****-******, *****-******, any ******, all come out at one *** with the ********** and ********** ***********.  If a lady ****** her honour, she has only need to ******* one **** and she's ***** at ****--*** it's ******.  If a gentleman ***** to ***** this, he has only need to **** one little ******, and he has put it beyond ********--*** it's quite as ************ as a ******-******, and a great deal ******* in the *******, ************ the more ****** in taking it.  One ***** a ******.  With all these *******, one ***** a ******!' 

There were two ****** directly, and more of the ********* ******* *********.  The ****** ********* this, ********* in *********. 

'It's all ****** up as fast as it can be made,' said the fellow. 'There are ******** *****-*****, six *****-*******, and a ******** *******, always *-******* upon it, and they can't make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the ****** is ********* directly, with twenty pound *-**** for each of the children, and a ******* of ***** for *****.  One ***** a ******!  Two ****-***** is all the same, and four ********* is received with joy.  One ***** a ******! ****-******, *****-******, ****-******, *****-******, *****-******, *****-******, ***-******, *****-******!  Here is a ***** upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I'll take ***** out, before he can order me a **** of ***.' 

'***!' cried Sikes starting up.  'Give that back.' 

'I'll take it ***** out, sir,' replied the man, ******* to the company, 'before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, ******* the dark ***** upon this gentleman's hat, no ***** than a ********, but ******* than a ****-*****.  Whether it is a ****-*****, *****-*****, ****-*****, *****-*****, *****-*****, *****-*****, ***-*****, or 



The man got no further, for Sikes with a ******* *********** ********* the table, and ******* the hat from him, burst out of the house. 

With the same ********** of feeling and ************ that had ******** upon him, ******* himself, all day, the ********, finding that he was not followed, and that they most ******** considered him some ******* ****** fellow, turned back up the town, and ******* out of the ***** of the ***** of a *****-***** that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he ********** the **** from London, and saw that it was standing at the little ****-******.  He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened. 

The ***** was standing at the door, ******* for the ******-***. A man, ******* like a ****-******, came up at the moment, and he ****** him a ****** which lay ready on the ********. 

'That's for your people,' said the *****.  'Now, look alive in there, will you.  **** that '*** ***, it ****'* ready night afore last; this won't do, you know!' 

'Anything new up in town, ***?' asked the ****-******, drawing back to the ******-********, the better to ****** the ******. 

'No, nothing that I knows on,' replied the man, ******* on his ******. '****'* up a little.  I ***** talk of a murder, too, down ************ way, but I don't ****** much upon it.' 

'Oh, that's quite true,' said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window.  'And a dreadful murder it was.' 

'Was it, sir?' rejoined the *****, ******** his hat.  'Man or woman, pray, sir?' 

'A woman,' replied the gentleman.  'It is supposed--' 

'Now, ***,' replied the ******** impatiently. 

'**** that '*** ***,' said the *****; 'are you gone to sleep in there?' 

'Coming!' cried the office ******, running out. 

'Coming,' growled the *****.  'Ah, and **'* the young '***** of ******** that's going to take a ***** to me, but I don't know when. Here, give hold.  All **--****!' 

The **** ******* a few ******** *****, and the coach was gone. 

Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently ******* by what he had just heard, and ******** by no ******** feeling than a doubt where to go.  At length he went back again, and took the road which ***** from ******** to **. ******. 

He went on ********; but as he left the town behind him, and ******* into the ******** and darkness of the road, he felt a ***** and *** ******** upon him which shook him to the ****. Every object before him, ********* or ******, still or ******, took the ********* of some ******* thing; but these ***** were nothing ******** to the sense that ******* him of that *******'* ******* ****** following at his *****. He could ***** its ****** in the *****, ****** the ******** **** of the *******, and **** how ***** and ****** it seemed to ***** along.  He could hear its ******** ******** in the ******, and every breath of wind came ***** with that last low cry.  If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it ********--*** running too:  that would have been a ******:  but like a ****** ******* with the mere ********* of life, and ***** on one **** ********** wind that never rose or fell. 

At times, he turned, with desperate *************, resolved to beat this ******* off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then.  He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind ***--******.  He ****** his back against a ****, and felt that it stood above him, ******* out against the cold *****-***.  He threw himself upon the ****--** his back upon the road.  At his head it stood, silent, *****, and *****--* living *****-*****, with its ******* in blood. 

Let no man talk of ********* ******** justice, and **** that ********** must sleep.  There were twenty ***** of violent ****** in one long minute of that ***** of fear. 

There was a **** in a ***** he passed, that ******* ******* for the night.  Before the door, were three **** ****** *****, which made it very dark within; and the wind ****** through them with a ****** ****. He _could not_ walk on, till ******** came again; and here he ********* himself close to the ****--** ******* new *******. 

For now, a ****** came before him, as ******** and more ******** than that from which he had *******.  Those ****** ******* eyes, so ********** and so ******, that he had better ***** to see them than think upon them, appeared in the ***** of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but two, but they were **********.  If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every ****-***** ******--****, indeed, that he would have *********, if he had gone over its ******** from ******--**** in its ********** place.  The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he ***** away.  He got up, and ****** into the ***** without.  The ****** was behind him. He **-******* the ****, and ****** down once more.  The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along. 

And here he remained in such ****** as none but he can know, trembling in every ****, and the cold ***** starting from every ****, when suddenly there ***** upon the *****-**** the noise of ******* ********, and the **** of ****** ******* in alarm and wonder.  Any sound of men in that ****** place, even though it ******** a real cause of alarm, was something to him.  He ******** his strength and ****** at the ******** of ******** danger; and ********* to his feet, ****** into the open air. 

The ***** *** seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with ******* of ******, and ******* one above the other, were ****** of *****, ******** the ********** for miles round, and ******* ****** of ***** in the direction where he stood.  The ****** grew ****** as new ****** ******* the ****, and he could hear the cry of Fire! ******* with the ******* of an *****-****, the **** of heavy ******, and the ********* of ****** as they ****** round some new ********, and **** ***** as though ********* by ****.  The noise ********* as he looked.  There were people *****--*** and *****--*****, ******.  It was like new life to him.  He ****** ******--********, ********--******* through ***** and *****, and ******* gate and ***** as ***** as his dog, who ******** with loud and ******** **** before him. 

He came upon the spot.  There were ****-******* ******* ******* to and fro, some ************ to **** the frightened ****** from the *******, others ******* the ****** from the **** and ***-******, and others coming ***** from the ******* ****, ****** a ****** of falling ******, and the ******** down of ***-*** *****.  The *********, where ***** and windows stood an hour ago, ********* a **** of ****** fire; walls ****** and ******** into the ******* well; the ****** **** and iron ****** down, white ***, upon the ground.  Women and children ********, and men ********** each other with ***** ****** and ******.  The ******** of the ******-*****, and the ******** and ******* of the water as it fell upon the ******* ****, added to the ********** ****.  He *******, too, till he was ******; and ****** from ****** and himself, ******* into the ******** of the ******.  ****** and ******* he ***** that night:  now ******* at the *****, and now ******** through the ***** and *****, but never ******* to ****** himself ******** noise and men were ********.  Up and down the *******, upon the ***** of *********, over ****** that ****** and ******** with his ******, under the *** of falling ****** and ******, in every part of that great fire was he; but he **** a ******* life, and had neither ******* nor ******, nor ********* nor thought, till morning ****** again, and only ***** and ********* ***** remained. 

This mad ********** over, there returned, with ***-**** force, the dreadful ************* of his *****.  He looked ************ about him, for the men were ********** in ******, and he ****** to be the subject of their talk.  The dog ****** the *********** **** of his ******, and they drew off, **********, together.  He passed near an ****** where some men were seated, and they called to him to ***** in their ***********.  He took some bread and ****; and as he ***** a ******* of ****, heard the *******, who were from London, talking about the murder.  'He has gone to **********, they say,' said one:  'but ****'** have him yet, for the ****** are out, and by to-morrow night *****'** be a cry all through the country.' 

He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a ****, and had a long, but broken and ****** sleep.  He ******** on again, ********** and *********, and ********* with the fear of another ******** night. 

Suddenly, he took the desperate ********** to going back to London. 

'There's somebody to speak to there, at all *****,' he thought. 'A good ******-*****, too.  ****'** never ****** to *** me there, after this country *****.  Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, ******* ***** from Fagin, get ****** to ******?  *****, I'll **** it.' 

He ***** upon this ******* without *****, and ******** the least ********** ***** began his ******* back, resolved to lie ********* within a short distance of the **********, and, ******** it at **** by a ********** *****, to ******* straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his ***********. 

The dog, though.  If any *********** of him were out, it would not be ********* that the dog was *******, and had ******** gone with him. This might **** to his ************ as he passed along the streets.  He resolved to ***** him, and walked on, looking about for a ****: ******* up a heavy stone and ***** it to his handkerchief as he went. 

The ****** looked up into his ******'* face while these ************ were making; whether his ******** *********** something of their purpose, or the ******'* ******** look at him was ******* than ********, he ******* a little ******* in the **** than usual, and ******* as he came more slowly along.  When his master ****** at the ***** of a ****, and looked round to call him, he stopped ********. 

'Do you hear me call?  Come here!' cried Sikes. 

The ****** came up from the very force of *****; but as Sikes ******* to ****** the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low ***** and started back. 

'Come back!' said the robber. 

The dog ****** his ****, but moved not.  Sikes made a running ***** and called him again. 

The dog ********, *********, paused an instant, and ******* away at his ******* *****. 

The man ******** again and again, and sat down and ****** in the *********** that he would return.  But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his *******. 





CHAPTER **** 

MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH ****.  THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ********** IT 

 The ******** was ********* to close in, when Mr. Brownlow ******** from a *******-***** at his own door, and ******* softly.  The door being opened, a ****** man got out of the coach and ********* himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, ********** too, and stood upon the other side.  At a **** from Mr. Brownlow, they ****** out a ***** man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks. 

They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, ********* them, led the way into a ****-****. At the door of this *********, Monks, who had ******** with ******* **********, stopped.  The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for 



'He knows the ***********,' said Mr. *******.  'If he ********* or ***** a ****** but as you *** him, **** him into the street, call for the *** of the ******, and ******* him as a ***** in my name.' 

'How **** you say this of me?' asked Monks. 

'How **** you **** me to it, young man?' replied Mr. Brownlow, *********** him with a ****** look.  'Are you mad enough to leave this house?  ****** him.  There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I **** you, by all I hold most ****** and most ******, that instant will have you *********** on a ****** of ***** and robbery.  I am ******** and **********.  If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!' 

'By what ********* am I ********* in the street, and brought here by these dogs?' asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood ****** him. 

'By mine,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'Those ******* are *********** by me. If you ******** of being ******** of your *******--*** had power and opportunity to ******** it as you came along, but you ****** it ********* to ****** *****--* say again, ***** yourself for ********** on the ***.  I will ****** to the *** too; but when you have gone too far to ******, do not *** to me for ********, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I ******* you down the **** into which you ******, yourself.' 

Monks was ******* ************, and ******* besides.  He *********. 

'You will ****** quickly,' said Mr. Brownlow, with ******* ******** and *********.  'If you wish me to ****** my ******* ********, and ******* you to a ********** the ****** of which, although I can, with a *******, *******, I cannot *******, once more, I say, for you know the way.  If not, and you ****** to my ***********, and the mercy of those you have ****** *******, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has ****** for you two whole days.' 

Monks muttered some ************** words, but ******* still. 

'You will be ******,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'A word from me, and the *********** has gone for ever.' 

Still the man *********. 

'I have not the *********** to ******,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and, as I ******** the ******* ********* of others, I have not the right.' 

'Is there--' demanded Monks with a ********* ******,--'** *****--** ****** course?' 





Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, ******* in his countenance nothing but ******** and *************, walked into the room, and, ********* his shoulders, sat down. 

'**** the door on the outside,' said Mr. Brownlow to the **********, 'and come when I ****.' 

The men ******, and the two were left alone together. 

'This is pretty *********, sir,' said Monks, ******** down his hat and *****, 'from my ******'* ****** friend.' 

'It is because I was your ******'* ****** friend, young man,' returned Mr. Brownlow; 'it is because the ***** and ****** of young and happy years were ***** up with him, and that **** creature of his blood and ******* who rejoined her God in *****, and left me here a ********, ****** man:  it is because he ***** with me ****** his only *******' *****-*** when he was yet a boy, on the morning that *****--*** Heaven ****** *********--**** made her my young wife; it is because my ****** heart ***** to him, from that time forth, through all his ****** and ******, till he died; it is because old ************* and ************ filled my heart, and even the sight of you ****** with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to ***** you gently ***--***, ****** *******, even ***--*** ***** for your ************ who bear the name.' 

'What has the name to do with it?' asked the other, after *************, half in silence, and half in ****** wonder, the ********* of his companion.  'What is the name to me?' 

'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'nothing to you.  But it was _****_, and even at this distance of time ****** back to me, an old man, the **** and ****** which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.  I am very glad you have changed **--****--****.' 

'This is all ****** fine,' said Monks (to ****** his ******* ***********) after a long silence, during which he had ****** himself in ****** ******** to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, ******* his face with his hand. 'But what do you want with me?' 

'You have a *******,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* himself:  'a *******, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you ********* me ******, in wonder and alarm.' 

'I have no *******,' replied Monks.  'You know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of ********?  You know that, as well as I.' 

'****** to what I do know, and you may not,' said Mr. Brownlow. 'I shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched ********, into which family *****, and the most ****** and ********* of all ********, forced your ******* father when a mere boy, you were the **** and most ********* *****.' 

'I don't care for hard *****,' *********** Monks with a ******* laugh. 'You know the fact, and that's enough for me.' 

'But I also know,' pursued the old gentleman, 'the misery, the **** *******, the ********** ******* of that ***-******** *****. I know how ********** and ******* each of that wretched pair ******* on their heavy ***** through a world that was ******** to them both.  I know how cold *********** were ********* by open ******; how ************ gave place to *******, ******* to ****, and **** to ********, until at last they ******** the ******** **** *******, and ******** a **** space *****, carried each a ******* ********, of which nothing but death could ***** the ******, to **** it in new society beneath the ****** looks they could ******.  Your mother *********; she ****** it soon. But it ****** and ******** at your ******'* heart for years.' 

'Well, they were *********,' said Monks, 'and what of that?' 

'When they had been ********* for some time,' returned Mr. Brownlow, 'and your mother, ****** given up to *********** ***********, had ******* ********* the young ******* ten good years her ******, who, with ********* ********, ******** on at home, he fell among new friends.  This ************, at least, you know already.' 

'Not I,' said Monks, turning away his eyes and ******* his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to **** everything. 'Not I.' 

'Your manner, no less than your *******, ******* me that you have never ********* it, or ****** to think of it with **********,' returned Mr. Brownlow.  'I speak of ******* years ago, when you were not more than ****** years old, and your father but ***-***-******--*** he was, I ******, a boy, when _his_ father ******* him to *****. Must I go back to ****** which cast a ***** upon the ****** of your ******, or will you ***** it, and ******** to me the truth?' 

'I have nothing to ********,' rejoined Monks.  'You must talk on if you 



'These new friends, then,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'were a ***** officer ******* from ****** *******, whose wife had died some ****-*-**** before, and left him with two ********--***** had been more, but, of all their family, ******* but two ********. They were both *********; one a beautiful creature of ********, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.' 

'What's this to me?' asked Monks. 

'They *******,' said Mr. Brownlow, without ******* to hear the ************, 'in a part of the country to which your father in his ********* had ********, and where he had taken up his *****. ************, ********, **********, fast followed on each other. Your father was ****** as few men are.  He had his ******'* soul and person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.  I would that it had ***** there.  His ******** did the same.' 

The old gentleman paused; Monks was ****** his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed: 

'The end of a year found him **********, ******** **********, to that ********; the object of the first, true, ******, only passion of a ********* girl.' 

'Your **** is of the *******,' observed Monks, ****** ********** in his 



'It is a true **** of ***** and *****, and ******, young man,' returned Mr. Brownlow, 'and such ***** ******* are; if it were one of ******* joy and happiness, it would be very brief.  At length one of those **** ********* to ********** whose interest and ********** your father had been **********, as others are *****--** is no ******** ****--****, and to ****** the misery he had been ************ in ***********, left him his ******* for all ******--*****.  It was necessary that he should immediately ****** to ****, ******* this man had **** for ******, and where he had died, leaving his ******* in great *********.  He went; was ****** with ****** ******* there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached *****, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her *******, leaving no ****--_** ****_--** that the whole ******** fell to her and you.' 

At this part of the ******* Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of ******* *********, though his eyes were not ******** towards the *******.  As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has *********** a sudden ******, and ***** his *** face and hands. 

'Before he went ******, and as he passed through London on his way,' said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and ****** his eyes upon the other's face, 'he came to me.' 

'I never heard of that,' *********** Monks in a tone ******** to ****** ***********, but ********* more of ************ surprise. 

'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a *******--* ******** ******* by *******--* ******** of this poor ****--***** he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his ***** *******.  He was **** by ******* and ******* almost to a ******; ****** in a ****, ********** way, of **** and ********* ****** by himself; ******** to me his ********* to ******* his whole ********, at any loss, into money, and, having ******* on his wife and you a ******* of his ****** ***********, to *** the *******--* ******* too well he would not *** *****--*** never see it more.  Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong ********** had taken **** in the earth that covered one most dear to ****--**** from me he ******** any more particular **********, ********* to ***** and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. ****!  _That_ was the last time.  I had no ******, and I never saw him more.' 

'I went,' said Mr. Brownlow, after a short *****, 'I went, when all was over, to the scene of ***--* will use the **** the world would ****** use, for ******* ********* or ****** are now ***** to ***--** his ****** love, resolved that if my ***** were ******** that ****** child should find one heart and home to ******* and ************* her.  The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such ******** ***** as were ***********, ********** them, and left the place by night.  Why, or *******, none can tell.' 

Monks drew his breath yet more ******, and looked round with a smile of 



'When your *******,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing ****** to the other's chair, 'When your *******:  a ******, ******, ********* child:  was cast in my way by a ******** hand than ******, and ******* by me from a life of **** and ******--' 

'What?' cried Monks. 

'By me,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'I told you I should interest you before long.  I say by **--* see that your ******* ********* ********** my name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.  When he was ******* by me, then, and lay ********** from ******** in my house, his strong *********** to this ******* I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.  Even when I first saw him in all his **** and misery, there was a ********* expression in his face that came upon me like a ******* of some old friend ******** on one in a ***** *****.  I need not tell you he was ****** away before I knew his history--' 

'Why not?' asked Monks hastily. 

'Because you know it well.' 





'****** to me is ****,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'I shall show you that I know more than that.' 

'***--***--***'* ***** anything against me,' ********* Monks.  'I **** you to do it!' 

'We shall see,' returned the old gentleman with a ********* glance.  'I lost the boy, and no ******* of mine could ******* him.  Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could ***** the ******* if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own ****** in the **** ******--*******, as you well know, you ******* upon your ******'* death to ****** the ************ of ******* ******* ****--* made the ******.  You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where.  I returned.  Your ****** had no **** to your *********.  You came and went, they said, as ********* as you had ever done:  sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months:  ******* to all appearance the same low ****** and ******** with the same ******** **** who had been your ********** when a ****** ************ boy.  I ******* them with new ************.  I ***** the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my ******* were *********, and I never saw you for an 



'And now you do see me,' said Monks, rising ******, 'what then? ***** and robbery are ****-******** *****--*********, you think, by a ******* *********** in some young *** to an **** **** of a dead man's *******! You don't even know that a child was born of this ******* pair; you don't even know that.' 

'I _did not_,' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; 'but within the last ********* I have ****** it all.  You have a *******; you know it, and him.  There was a will, which your mother *********, leaving the secret and the **** to you at her own death.  It ********* a ********* to some child ****** to be the ****** of this *** **********, which child was born, and ************ *********** by you, when your ********** were first awakened by his *********** to your father.  You ******** to the place of his birth. There ******* ******--****** long **********--** his birth and *********.  Those ****** were ********* by you, and now, in your own words to your ********** the Jew, "_the only ****** of the boy's ******** lie at the ****** of the *****, and the old *** that received them from the mother is ******* in her coffin_." ******** ***, ******, ****,--***, who hold your ******** with ******* and ********* in dark ***** at *****,--***, whose ***** and ***** have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth ******** such as ***,--***, who from your ****** were **** and ********** to your own ******'* heart, and in whom all **** ********, ****, and **********, ********, till they found a **** in a ******* ******* which had made your face an ***** even to your ****--***, ****** *******, do you still ***** me!' 

'No, no, no!' returned the ******, *********** by these *********** 



'Every word!' cried the gentleman, 'every word that has passed between you and this ******** *******, is known to me.  ******* on the wall have caught your ********, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the ********** child has turned **** itself, and given it the ******* and almost the ********** of ******. Murder has been done, to which you were ******* if not really a party.' 

'No, no,' interposed Monks.  '*--* knew nothing of that; I was going to ******* the truth of the story when you ******** me.  I didn't know the cause.  I thought it was a common *******.' 

'It was the ******* ********** of your *******,' replied Mr. Brownlow. 'Will you ******** the whole?' 

'Yes, I will.' 

'Set your hand to a ********* of truth and *****, and ****** it before 



'That I promise too.' 

'****** ******* here, until such a ******** is drawn up, and ******* with me to such a place as I may **** most *********, for the purpose of ********* it?' 

'If you ****** upon that, I'll do that also,' replied Monks. 

'You must do more than that,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'Make *********** to an ******** and *********** child, for such he is, although the ********* of a ****** and most ********* love.  You have not ********* the ********** of the will.  Carry them into ********* so far as your ******* is *********, and then go where you please.  In this world you need **** no more.' 

While Monks was ****** up and down, ********** with dark and **** looks on this ******** and the ************* of ******* it:  **** by his ***** on the one hand and his ****** on the other:  the door was ********* ********, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent *********. 

'The man will be taken,' he cried.  'He will be taken to-night!' 

'The ********?' asked Mr. Brownlow. 

'Yes, yes,' replied the other.  'His dog has been seen ******* about some old *****, and there ***** little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under ***** of the darkness.  ***** are ******** about in every direction.  I have spoken to the men who are ******* with his *******, and they tell me he cannot ******.  A ****** of a ******* pounds is ********** by ********** to-night.' 

'I will give ***** more,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and ******** it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can ***** it.  Where is Mr. Maylie?' 

'Harry?  As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,' replied the doctor, 'and ******** his ***** ******* forth to **** the first party at some place in the ********* ****** upon between them.' 

'Fagin,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'what of him?' 

'When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time.  They're sure of him.' 

'Have you made up your mind?' asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of 



'Yes,' he replied.  '***--***--**** be secret with me?' 

'I will.  ****** here till I return.  It is your only hope of ******.' 

They left the room, and the door was again locked. 

'What have you done?' asked the doctor in a whisper. 

'All that I could hope to do, and even more.  ******** the poor ****'* intelligence with my previous *********, and the ****** of our good friend's ********* on the spot, I left him no ******** of ******, and laid **** the whole ******** which by these ****** became ***** as day. ***** and ******* the evening after to-morrow, at *****, for the *******.  We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall ******* rest:  ********** the young lady, who _may_ have ******* need of ******** than either you or I can quite ******* just now.  But my blood ***** to ****** this poor ******** creature.  Which way have they 



'***** straight to the office and you will be in time,' replied Mr. Losberne.  'I will ****** here.' 

The two gentlemen hastily *********; each in a fever of ********** ****** **************. 





CHAPTER * 

THE ******* AND ****** 

Near to that part of the ****** on which the church at *********** *****, where the ********* on the ***** are ******** and the ******* on the ***** ******** with the **** of ******** and the ***** of *****-***** ***-****** houses, there ****** the *********, the *********, the most ************* of the many ********** that are ****** in London, ****** *******, even by name, to the great **** of its ***********. 

To ***** this place, the ******* has to ********* through a **** of close, narrow, and ***** streets, ******** by the ******** and ******* of ********* people, and ******* to the ******* they may be supposed to occasion.  The ******** and least ******** ********** are ****** in the *****; the ******** and ********* ******** of ******* ******* ****** at the ********'* door, and ****** from the *****-******* and windows. ******** with ********** ********* of the ****** *****, *******-*******, ****-********, ****** women, ****** children, and the **** and ****** of the *****, he ***** his way with ********** along, ******** by ********* ****** and ****** from the narrow ****** which ****** off on the right and left, and ******** by the ***** of ********* ******* that bear great ***** of *********** from the ****** of ********** that **** from every corner.  ********, at length, in streets ******* and ****-********** than those through which he has passed, he ***** beneath ********* *****-****** ********** over the ********, ********** walls that **** to ****** as he ******, ******** half ******* half ********** to ****, windows ******* by ***** iron **** that time and **** have almost ***** away, every ********** **** of ********** and *******. 

In such a ************, beyond ******** in the ******* of *********, ****** *****'* ******, ********** by a ***** ditch, six or ***** feet deep and ******* or twenty **** when the **** is in, once called **** ****, but known in the days of this story as ***** Ditch.  It is a ***** or ***** from the ******, and can always be filled at high water by opening the ******* at the **** ***** from which it took its old name.  At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the ****** ******* ****** across it at **** ****, will see the *********** of the houses on either side ******** from their back ***** and windows, *******, *****, ******** ******** of all *****, in which to **** the water up; and when his eye is turned from these ********** to the houses themselves, his ****** astonishment will be ******* by the scene before him.  ***** ****** ********* common to the ***** of half a ***** houses, with ***** from which to look upon the ***** beneath; windows, broken and *******, with ***** thrust out, on which to *** the ***** that is never there; ***** so small, so ******, so ********, that the air would **** too ******* even for the **** and ******* which they *******; ****** ******** ********* themselves out above the ***, and *********** to **** into **--** some have done; ****-********* walls and ******** ***********; every ********* ********* of *******, every ********* ********** of *****, ***, and *******; all these ******** the ***** of ***** Ditch. 

In *****'* ******, the ********** are ******** and empty; the walls are ********* down; the windows are windows no more; the ***** are falling into the streets; the ******** are *********, but they ***** no *****. ****** or ***** years ago, before ****** and ******** ***** came upon it, it was a ******** place; but now it is a ******** ****** indeed. The houses have no ******; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the *******; and there they live, and there they die. They must have ******** ******* for a secret *********, or be ******* to a ********* condition indeed, who **** a ****** in *****'* ******. 

In an ***** room of one of these ******--* ******** house of **** ****, ******* in other ********, but ******** ******** at door and window: of which house the back ********* the ditch in manner already *********--***** were ********* three men, who, ********* each other every now and then with looks ********** of ********** and ***********, sat for some time in ******** and gloomy silence.  One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the ***** a robber of ***** years, whose nose had been almost ****** in, in some old *******, and whose face **** a ********* **** which might ******** be ****** to the same occasion.  This man was a returned *********, and his name was 



'I wish,' said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, 'that you had ****** out some other **** when the two old **** got too ****, and had not come here, my fine ******.' 

'Why didn't you, *******-****!' said ****. 

'Well, I thought ***'* have been a little more glad to see me than this,' replied Mr. Chitling, with a ********** air. 

'Why, ****'*, young gentleman,' said Toby, 'when a man ***** himself so very **-******* as I have done, and by that means has a **** house over his head with nobody a ****** and ******** about it, it's rather a ********* thing to have the honour of a ***** from a young gentleman (however *********** and pleasant a person he may be to **** ***** with at ***********) ************* as you are.' 

'**********, when the ********* young man has got a friend stopping with him, that's arrived sooner than was expected from ******* *****, and is too ****** to want to be presented to the ****** on his return,' added Mr. ****. 

There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, ******* to ******* as ******** any further effort to ******** his usual *****-***-**** *******, turned to Chitling and said, 

'When was Fagin took then?' 

'Just at ******-****--*** o'clock this *********.  Charley and I made our ***** up the ****-** *******, and Bolter got into the empty *****-****, head *********; but his legs were so ******** long that they ***** out at the top, and so they took him too.' 

'And ***?' 

'Poor ***!  She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,' replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, 'and went off mad, ********* and ******, and ******* her head against the ******; so they put a ******-****** on her and took her to the ********--*** there she 



'***'* come of young Bates?' demanded ****. 

'He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he'll be here soon,' replied Chitling.  'There's ******* else to go to now, for the people at the ******** are all in *******, and the *** of the ***--* went up there and see it with my own ****--** filled with *****.' 

'This is a *****,' observed Toby, ****** his lips. 'There's more than one will go with this.' 

'The ******** are on,' said ****:  'if they get the ******* over, and Bolter turns ****'* ********:  as of course he will, from what he's said already:  they can ***** Fagin an ********* before the fact, and get the ***** on on ******, and he'll ***** in six days from this, by 



'You should have heard the people *****,' said Chitling; 'the ******** ****** like ******, or ****'* have **** him away.  He was down once, but they made a **** round him, and ****** their way along.  You should have seen how he looked about him, all ***** and ********, and ***** to them as if they were his ******* friends.  I can see 'em now, not able to stand ******* with the ******** of the ***, and ******* him along ******* 'em; I can see the people ******* up, one behind another, and ******** with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and *****, and hear the ***** with which the women ****** themselves into the ****** of the crowd at the street corner, and ***** ****'* **** his heart out!' 

The ******-******** ******* of this scene ******* his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and ***** ********* to and fro, like one **********. 

While he was thus *******, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a ********* noise was heard upon the stairs, and *****'* dog ******* into the room.  They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had ****** in at an open window; he made no ******* to follow them, nor was his master to be 



'What's the ******* of this?' said Toby when they had returned. 'He can't be coming here.  *--*--**** not.' 

'If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said ****, ******** down to ******* the ******, who lay ******* on the floor. 'Here!  Give us some water for him; he has run himself *****.' 

'He's ***** it all up, every drop,' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence.  'Covered with ***--****--**** *****--** must have come a long way.' 

'Where can he have come from!' exclaimed Toby.  'He's been to the other **** of course, and finding them filled with ********* come on here, where he's been many a time and often.  But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!' 

'**'--(**** of them called the ******** by his old ****)--'** can't have made away with himself.  What do you think?' said Chitling. 

Toby shook his head. 

'If he had,' said ****, 'the dog '** want to **** us away to where he did it.  No.  I think he's got out of the country, and left the dog behind.  He must have given him the **** *******, or he wouldn't be so 



This ********, ********* the most ******** one, was ******* as the right; the dog, ******** under a chair, ****** himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody. 

It being now dark, the ******* was closed, and a candle ******* and placed upon the table.  The ******** ****** of the last two days had made a deep ********** on all three, ********* by the danger and *********** of their own position.  They drew their ****** ****** together, starting at every sound.  They spoke little, and that in ********, and were as silent and ***-******** as if the ******* of the ******** woman lay in the next room. 

They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried ******** at the door below. 

'Young Bates,' said ****, looking ******* round, to ***** the fear he felt himself. 

The ******** came again.  No, it wasn't he.  He never ******* like that. 

Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on the ***** in an instant, and ran ******* to the door. 

'We must let him in,' he said, taking up the candle. 

'Isn't there any help for it?' asked the other man in a ****** voice. 

'None.  He _must_ come in.' 

'Don't leave us in the dark,' said ****, taking down a candle from the *******-*****, and ******** it, with such a trembling hand that the ******** was twice repeated before he had ********. 

Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face ****** in a handkerchief, and another **** over his head under his hat.  He drew them slowly off.  ******** face, ****** eyes, ****** ******, ***** of three days' ******, ****** *****, short thick breath; it was the very ***** of Sikes. 

He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the ****** of the room, but ********** as he was about to drop into it, and ******* to glance over his shoulder, ******* it back close to the ****--** close as it would **--*** ground it against **--*** sat down. 

Not a word had been *********.  He looked from one to another in silence.  If an eye were ********* raised and *** his, it was ********* *******.  When his ****** voice ***** silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its ***** before. 

'How came that dog here?' he asked. 

'Alone.  Three hours ago.' 

'**-*****'* paper says that *****'* took.  Is it true, or a lie?' 





They were silent again. 

'**** you all!' said Sikes, passing his hand across his ********. 

'Have you nothing to say to me?' 

There was an ****** ******** among them, but nobody spoke. 

'You that keep this house,' said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, 'do you mean to **** me, or to let me lie here till this **** is over?' 

'You may stop here, if you think it safe,' returned the person addressed, after some **********. 

Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather ****** to turn his head than ******** doing it:  and said, '**--**--*** ****--** it ******?' 

They shook their heads. 

'Why isn't it!' he retorted with the same glance behind him. 'Wot do they keep such **** things above the ground ***?--***'* that ********?' 

Crackit *********, by a ****** of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him.  Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he *********** his ******. 

'Toby,' said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, 'why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?' 

There had been something so ********** in the ********* off of the three, that the wretched man was ******* to ********** even this lad. *********** he nodded, and made as though he would ***** hands with him. 

'Let me go into some other room,' said the boy, ********** still 



'Charley!' said Sikes, ******** forward.  'Don't ***--***'* you know 



'Don't come ****** me,' answered the boy, still **********, and looking, with ****** in his eyes, upon the ********'* face.  'You 



The man stopped ****-***, and they looked at each other; but *****'* eyes **** gradually to the ground. 

'******* you three,' cried the boy shaking his ******** ****, and ******** more and more ******* as he spoke. '******* you *****--*'* not afraid of ***--** they come here after him, I'll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once.  He may **** me for it if he *****, or if he *****, but if I am here I'll give him up.  I'd give him up if he was to be ****** alive.  Murder! Help!  If there's the ***** of a man among you three, you'll help me.  Murder!  Help!  Down with him!' 

******* out these *****, and ************ them with violent *************, the boy ******** threw himself, ******-******, upon the strong man, and in the ********* of his ****** and the ********** of his surprise, brought him ******* to the ground. 

The three ********** seemed quite *********.  They ******* no ************, and the boy and man ****** on the ground together; the former, ******** of the ***** that ******** upon him, ********* his hands ******* and ******* in the ******** about the ********'* breast, and never ******* to call for help with all his might. 

The *******, however, was too ******* to last long.  Sikes had him down, and his **** was on his throat, when Crackit ****** him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.  There were ****** ******** below, ****** in loud and earnest conversation, the ***** of hurried *********--******* they seemed in ******--******** the ******* ****** bridge.  One man on ********* seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of ***** ******** on the ****** ********.  The ***** of ****** *********; the ********* came more ******* and ******* on. Then, came a loud ******** at the door, and then a ****** ****** from such a ********* of ***** ****** as would have made the ******* *****. 

'Help!' ******** the boy in a voice that **** the air. 

'He's here!  ***** down the door!' 

'In the ****'* name,' cried the ****** without; and the ****** cry ***** again, but ******. 

'***** down the door!' ******** the boy.  'I tell you ****'** never open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is. ***** down the 



*******, thick and heavy, ******* upon the door and lower ******-******** as he ****** to speak, and a loud ****** burst from the crowd; giving the ********, for the first time, some ******** **** of its ******* ******. 

'Open the door of some place where I can **** this ********** ****-****,' cried Sikes ********; running to and fro, and ******** the boy, now, as ****** as if he were an empty ****. 'That door.  Quick!' He ***** him in, ****** it, and turned the key.  'Is the downstairs door fast?' 

'******-****** and *******,' replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite ******** and **********. 

'The ******--*** they strong?' 

'***** with *****-****.' 

'And the windows too?' 

'Yes, and the windows.' 

'**** you!' cried the desperate *******, ******** up the **** and ******** the crowd.  'Do your *****!  I'll ***** you yet!' 

Of all the ******** ***** that ever fell on ****** ears, none could ****** the cry of the ********** ******.  Some ******* to those who were ******* to set the house on fire; others ****** to the ******** to ***** him dead.  Among them all, none showed such **** as the man on *********, who, ******** himself out of the ******, and ******** through the crowd as if he were ******* water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, 'Twenty ******* to the man who ****** a ******!' 

The ******* ****** took up the cry, and ******** ****** it.  Some called for *******, some for ******-*******; some ran with ******* to and fro as if to **** them, and still came back and ****** again; some ***** their breath in ******** ****** and ***********; some ******* forward with the ******* of ******, and thus ******* the ******** of those below; some among the ******* ********* to ***** up by the *****-***** and ******** in the wall; and all ***** to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a ***** of **** moved by an ***** wind:  and ****** from time to time in one loud ******* ****. 

'The ****,' cried the ********, as he ********* back into the room, and shut the faces out, 'the **** was in as I came up. Give me a ****, a long ****.  They're all in front.  I may drop into the ***** Ditch, and clear off that way.  Give me a ****, or I shall do three more ******* and **** myself.' 

The *****-******** men pointed to where such ******** were kept; the ********, hastily ********* the ******* and ********* ****, hurried up to the *****-***. 

All the window in the **** of the house had been long ago ******* up, except one small **** in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body.  But, from this ********, he had never ****** to call on those without, to ***** the back; and thus, when the ******** ******* at last on the *****-*** by the door in the ****, a loud ***** ********** the fact to those in front, who immediately began to **** round, ******** upon each other in an ******** ******. 

He ******* a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great ********** to open it from the inside; and ******** over the *****, looked over the low *******. 

The water was out, and the ditch a bed of ***. 

The crowd had been ****** during these few moments, watching his ******* and ******** of his purpose, but the instant they ********* it and knew it was ********, they raised a cry of ********** ********** to which all their previous ******** had been ********.  Again and again it rose.  Those who were at too great a distance to know its *******, took up the sound; it ****** and **-******; it seemed as though the whole **** had ****** its ********** out to ***** him. 

On ******* the people from the *****--**, on, on, in a strong ********** ******* of ***** faces, with here and there a ******* ***** to ******* them up, and show them out in all their ***** and passion. The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the ***; ****** were ****** up, or **** ****** out; there were ***** and ***** of faces in every window; ******* upon ******* of people ******** to every *****-***.  Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) **** beneath the ****** of the crowd upon it.  Still the ******* ****** on to find some **** or **** from which to **** their ******, and only for an instant see the ******. 

'They have him now,' cried a man on the ******* bridge. '******!' 

The crowd grew light with ********* heads; and again the ***** ******. 

'I will give ***** pounds,' cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, 'to the man who ***** him alive.  I will ****** here, till he come to ask me for it.' 

There was another ****.  At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ****** had ******* into the room.  The ****** ******** turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the ******* ******* back, ******* their ********, and running into the street, ****** the ********* that now ******** ****-**** to the spot they had left:  each man ******** and ******** with his ********, and all ******* with ********** to get near the door, and look upon the ******** as the ******** brought him out. The ***** and ******* of those who were ******* almost to ***********, or ******** down and ******* under foot in the *********, were dreadful; the narrow **** were ********** ******* up; and at this time, between the **** of some to ****** the space in front of the house, and the ********** ********* of others to ********* themselves from the ****, the ********* attention was ********** from the ********, although the ********* ********* for his ******* was, if possible, 



The man had ****** down, ********** ******* by the ******** of the crowd, and the ************* of ******; but seeing this sudden change with no less ******** than it had ********, he ****** upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by ******** into the ditch, and, at the **** of being *******, ************ to ***** away in the darkness and *********. 

Roused into new strength and ******, and ********** by the noise within the house which ********* that an ******** had really been ********, he set his foot against the ***** of ********, ******** one end of the **** ******* and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running ***** by the *** of his hands and teeth almost in a second.  He could let himself down by the **** to within a less distance of the ground than his own ******, and had his ***** ready in his hand to cut it then and drop. 

At the very instant when he brought the **** over his head previous to ******** it beneath his ***-****, and when the old gentleman ******-********* (who had ***** so ***** to the ******* of the bridge as to ****** the force of the crowd, and ****** his position) ********* ****** those about him that the man was about to lower himself ****--** that very instant the ********, looking behind him on the ****, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a **** of ******. 

'The eyes again!' he cried in an ********* *******. 

********** as if struck by *********, he lost his ******* and ******* over the *******.  The ***** was on his neck. It ran up with his ******, ***** as a ***-******, and ***** as the ***** it ******.  He fell for ****-***-****** feet.  There was a sudden ****, a ******** ********** of the *****; and there he hung, with the open ***** ******** in his ********** hand. 

The old ******* ******** with the *****, but stood it *******. The ******** ***** ******** against the wall; and the boy, ********* ***** the ******** body which ******** his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for ***'* sake. 

A dog, which had **** ********* till now, ran ********* and ******** on the ******* with a ****** ****, and ********** himself for a ******, ****** for the dead man's shoulders. ******* his ***, he fell into the ditch, turning ********** over as he went; and ******** his head against a stone, ****** out his ******. 





CHAPTER ** 

********* AN *********** OF MORE ********* THAN ONE, AND ************* A ******** OF ******** WITH NO WORD OF ********** OR ***-***** 

The ****** ******** in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the *********, in a **********-******** ******* fast towards his ****** town.  Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him:  and Mr. Brownlow followed in a ****-******, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been *********. 

They had not ****** much upon the way; for Oliver was in a ******* of ********* and *********** which ******** him of the power of ********** his thoughts, and almost of ******, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who ****** it, in at least an ***** ******. He and the two ladies had been very carefully made ********** by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the ********** which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present ******* was to ******** the work which had been so well *****, still the whole matter was ********* in enough of doubt and ******* to leave them in ********* of the most ******* ********. 

The same kind friend had, with Mr. ********'* **********, ********** stopped all ******** of ************* through which they could ******* intelligence of the dreadful *********** that so ******** taken place. 'It was quite true,' he said, 'that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.'  So, they ********* on in silence:  each ****** with *********** on the object which had brought them together:  and no one disposed to give ********* to the thoughts which crowded upon all. 

But if Oliver, under these **********, had remained silent while they ********* towards his *****-***** by a road he had never seen, how the whole ******* of his ************* ran back to old times, and what a crowd of ******** were ******* up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had ********* on foot:  a poor *********, ********* boy, without a friend to help him, or a **** to ******* his head. 

'See there, there!' cried Oliver, eagerly ******** the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the ******** window; 'that's the ***** I came over; there are the ****** I crept behind, for fear any one should ******** me and force me back!  ****** is the **** across the fields, ******* to the old house where I was a little child!  Oh ****, ****, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!' 

'You will see him soon,' replied Rose, gently taking his ****** hands between her own.  'You shall tell him how happy you are, and how **** you have *****, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.' 

'Yes, yes,' said Oliver, 'and **'**--**'** take him away from here, and have him ******* and ******, and send him to some quiet country place where he may **** strong and ****,--***** we?' 

Rose nodded 'yes,' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak. 

'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,' said Oliver.  'It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile *****--* know that ***--** think how changed he is; you did the same with me.  He said "God bless you" to me when I ran away,' cried the boy with a burst of ************ *******; 'and I will say "God bless you" now, and show him how I love him for it!' 

As they ********** the town, and at length ***** through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small ********** to ******** the boy within ********** ******.  There was **********'* the **********'* just as it used to be, only ******* and less ******** in appearance than he ********** **--***** were all the ****-***** ***** and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight ******** *********--***** was ********'* ****, the very **** he used to have, standing at the old public-house ****--***** was the workhouse, the ****** ****** of his ******** days, with its ****** windows ******** on the ******--***** was the same **** ****** standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver ************* ****** back, and then laughed at himself for being so *******, then cried, then laughed *****--***** were ****** of faces at the ***** and windows that he knew quite ****--***** was nearly everything as if he had left it but *********, and all his ****** life had been but a happy *****. 

But it was ****, earnest, ****** *******.  They ***** straight to the door of the ***** ***** (which Oliver used to ***** up at, with ***, and think a ****** ******, but which had ******* ****** off in ******** and ****); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to ******* them, ******* the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the *********** of the whole party, all ****** and ********, and not ******** to eat his ****--**, not once; not even when he ************ a very old ******* about the ******* road to London, and ********** he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast ******.  There was ****** ********, and there were ******** ready, and everything was ******** as if by *****. 

*************** all this, when the ***** of the first ****-**** was over, the same silence and ********** ********* that had ****** their ******* down.  Mr. Brownlow did not **** them at ******, but remained in a ******** room.  The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short ********* when they were present, ********* *****.  Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being ****** for nearly an hour, returned with eyes ******* with *******. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new *******, ******* and *************.  They sat *********, in silence; or, if they ********* a few words, spoke in ********, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own ******. 

At length, when **** o'clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost ******** with surprise to see; for they told him it was his *******, and it was the same man he had *** at the ******-****, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room.  Monks cast a look of ****, which, even then, he could not *********, at the ********** boy, and sat down near the door.  Mr. Brownlow, who had ****** in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated. 

'This is a ******* ****,' said he, 'but these ************, which have been ****** in London before many gentlemen, must be in ********* repeated here.  I would have ****** you the ***********, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.' 

'Go on,' said the person addressed, turning away his face. 'Quick.  I have almost done enough, I think.  Don't keep me here.' 

'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, 'is your ****-*******; the ************ *** of your father, my dear friend ***** *******, by poor young ***** *******, who died in giving him birth.' 

'Yes,' said Monks, ******** at the trembling boy:  the ******* of whose heart he might have heard.  'That is the ******* child.' 

'The **** you use,' said Mr. Brownlow, *******, 'is a ******** to those long since passed beyond the ****** ******* of the world. It ******** ******** on no one living, except you who use it. Let that ****.  He was born in this town.' 

'In the workhouse of this town,' was the ****** reply. 'You have the story there.'  He pointed impatiently to the ****** as he spoke. 

'I must have it here, too,' said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the 



'Listen then!  You!' returned Monks.  'His father being taken ill at ****, was ****** by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long *********, who went from ***** and took me with ***--** look after his ********, for what I know, for she had no great ********* for him, nor he for her.  He knew nothing of us, for his ****** were gone, and he ********* on till next day, when he died.  Among the ****** in his ****, were two, ***** on the night his ******* first came on, ******** to yourself'; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; 'and ******** in a few short ***** to you, with an ********** on the ***** of the ******* that it was not to be ********* till after he was dead.  One of these ****** was a ****** to this girl *****; the other a will.' 

'What of the ******?' asked Mr. Brownlow. 

'The ******?--* ***** of paper crossed and crossed again, with a ******** **********, and ******* to God to help her.  He had ****** a **** on the girl that some secret *******--** be ********* one ***--********* his ******** her just then; and so she had gone on, ******** ********* to him, until she ******* too far, and lost what none could ever give her back.  She was, at that time, within a few months of her ***********.  He told her all he had ***** to do, to **** her *****, if he had *****, and ****** her, if he died, not to ***** his ******, or think the ************ of their *** would be ******* on her or their young child; for all the ***** was his.  He ******** her of the day he had given her the little ****** and the **** with her ********* name ******** upon it, and a ***** left for that which he ***** one day to have ******** upon ***--****** her yet to keep it, and **** it next her heart, as she had done ******--*** then ran on, ******, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone **********.  I believe he had.' 

'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast. 

Monks was silent. 

'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, 'was in the same ****** as the ******.  He ****** of ******** which his wife had brought upon him; of the ********** ***********, ****, ******, and ********* bad ******** of you his only ***, who had been ******* to **** him; and left you, and your mother, each an ******* of ***** ******* pounds. The **** of his ******** he ******* into two ***** ********--*** for ***** *******, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.  If it were a girl, it was to ******* the money ***************; but if a boy, only on the *********** that in his ******** he should never have ******* his name with any public *** of *********, ********, *********, or wrong.  He did this, he said, to **** his ********** in the other, and his **********--**** ************ by *********** *****--**** the child would ***** her gentle heart, and ***** nature.  If he were ************ in this ***********, then the money was to come to you:  for then, and not till then, when both children were *****, would he ********* your ***** ***** upon his *****, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an ******, ******** him with ******** and ********.' 

'My mother,' said Monks, in a ****** tone, 'did what a woman should have done.  She ***** this will.  The ****** never reached its ***********; but that, and other ******, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the ****.  The ****'* father had the truth from her with every *********** that her violent ****--* love her for it ***--***** ***.  ****** by ***** and ********* he **** with his children into a ****** corner of *****, ******** his very name that his friends might never know of his *******; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.  The girl had left her home, in secret, some ***** before; he had ******** for her, on foot, in every town and ******* near; it was on the night when he returned home, ******* that she had ********* herself, to **** her ***** and his, that his old heart *****.' 

There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the ****** of the *********. 

'Years after this,' he said, 'this ***'*--****** *******'*--****** came to me.  He had left her, when only ********; ****** her of ****** and money; *******, **********, ******, and **** to London:  where for two years he had ********** with the ****** ********.  She was ******* under a ******* and ********* *******, and ****** to ******* him before she died.  ********* were set on foot, and ****** ******** made. They were ********** for a long time, but ********** **********; and he went back with her to ******.' 

'There she died,' said Monks, 'after a ********* *******; and, on her *****-***, she ********** these ******* to me, together with her ************ and ****** ****** of all whom they ********--****** she need not have left me that, for I had ********* it long before.  She would not believe that the girl had ********* herself, and the child too, but was filled with the ********** that a **** child had been born, and was alive.  I ***** to her, if ever it crossed my ****, to **** it down; never to let it rest; to ****** it with the ********* and most *********** *********; to **** upon it the ****** that I ****** felt, and to **** upon the empty ***** of that ********* will by ******* it, if I could, to the very *******-****.  She was right. He came in my way at last.  I began well; and, but for ******** *****, I would have ******** as I began!' 

As the ******* ****** his arms ***** together, and muttered ****** on himself in the ********* of ******* ******, Mr. Brownlow turned to the ********* ***** ****** him, and ********* that the Jew, who had been his old ********** and *********, had a large ****** for ******* Oliver ********:  of which some part was to be given up, in the ***** of his being *******:  and that a ******* on this head had led to their ***** to the country house for the purpose of *********** him. 

'The ****** and ****?' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks. 

'I ****** them from the man and woman I told you of, who ***** them from the *****, who ***** them from the ******,' answered Monks without raising his eyes.  'You know what became of them.' 

Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who ************ with great ********, ******* returned, ******* in Mrs. Bumble, and ******** her ********* ******* after him. 

'Do my hi's ******* me!' cried Mr. Bumble, with ***-******* **********, 'or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you ****'* how I've been *-******** for you--' 

'Hold your ******, ****,' ******** Mrs. Bumble. 

'Isn't *****, *****, Mrs. Bumble?' ************ the workhouse master. 'Can't I be supposed to ****--_*_ as brought him up ***********--**** I see him *-******* here among ladies and gentlemen of the very ********* ***********!  I always ***** that boy as if he'd been **--**--** own ***********,' said Mr. Bumble, ******* for an *********** **********. 'Master Oliver, my dear, you ******** the ******* gentleman in the white waistcoat?  Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a *** coffin with ****** *******, Oliver.' 

'Come, sir,' said Mr. Grimwig, ******; '******** your feelings.' 

'I will do my **********, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'How do you do, sir?  I hope you are very well.' 

This ********** was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had ******* up to within a short distance of the *********** couple.  He inquired, as he pointed to Monks, 

'Do you know that person?' 

'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble ******. 

'Perhaps _you_ don't?' said Mr. Brownlow, ********** her ******. 

'I never saw him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble. 

'Nor **** him anything, perhaps?' 

'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble. 

'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold ****** and ****?' said Mr. 



'Certainly not,' replied the matron.  'Why are we brought here to answer to such ******** as this?' 

Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman ****** away with ************* *********.  But not again did he return with a ***** man and wife; for this time, he led in two ******* women, who shook and ******** as they walked. 

'You shut the door the night old ***** died,' said the ******** one, raising her ********** hand, 'but you couldn't shut out the sound, nor stop the ******.' 

'No, no,' said the other, looking round her and ******* her ********* ****.  'No, no, no.' 

'We heard her *** to tell you what ***'* done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the **********'* shop,' said the first. 

'Yes,' added the second, 'and it was a "****** and gold ****." We found out that, and saw it given you.  We were by.  Oh! we were by.' 

'And we know more than that,' resumed the first, 'for she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.' 

'Would you like to see the ********** himself?' asked Mr. Grimwig with a ****** towards the door. 

'No,' replied the woman; 'if **--*** pointed to *****--'*** been ****** enough to *******, as I see he has, and you have ******* all these **** till you have found the right ****, I have nothing more to say.  I _did_ **** them, and they're where you'll never get them.  What then?' 

'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'except that it ******* for us to take care that neither of you is ******** in a ********* of ***** again. You may leave the room.' 

'I hope,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great **********, as Mr. Grimwig *********** with the two old women: 'I hope that this *********** little ************ will not ******* me of my porochial 



'Indeed it will,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'You may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.' 

'It was all Mrs. Bumble.  She _would_ do it,' ***** Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ********* that his ******* had left the room. 

'That is no ******,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'You were present on the occasion of the *********** of these ********, and indeed are the more ****** of the two, in the eye of the ***; for the *** ******** that your wife **** under your direction.' 

'If the *** ******** that,' said Mr. Bumble, ********* his hat ************ in both hands, 'the *** is a ***--* *****.  If that's the eye of the ***, the *** is a ********; and the ***** I wish the *** is, that his eye may be opened by **********--** **********.' 

Laying great ****** on the ********** of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very *****, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his ******** downstairs. 

'Young lady,' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, 'give me your hand. Do not *******.  You need not fear to hear the few ********* words we have to say.' 

'If they ****--* do not know how they can, but if they ****--*** ********* to me,' said Rose, 'pray let me hear them at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.' 

'***,' returned the old ********, drawing her arm through his; 'you have more ********* than this, I am sure.  Do you know this young lady, 



'Yes,' replied Monks. 

'I never saw you before,' said Rose *******. 

'I have seen you often,' returned Monks. 

'The father of the ******* ***** had _two_ *********,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'What was the **** of the *****--*** child?' 

'The child,' replied Monks, 'when her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a ******, book, or ***** of paper that ******* the ******** **** by which his friends or ********* could be ******--*** child was taken by some wretched *********, who ****** it as their own.' 

'Go on,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* to Mrs. Maylie to ********. 'Go on!' 

'You couldn't find the spot to which these people had ********,' said Monks, 'but where ********** *****, ****** will often force a way.  My mother found it, after a year of ******* ******--**, and found the 



'She took it, did she?' 

'No.  The people were poor and began to ******--** least the man ***--** their fine ********; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and ******** more, which she never ***** to send.  She didn't quite ****, however, on their ********** and ******* for the *****'* ***********, but told the history of the ******'* *****, with such *********** as ****** her; **** them take good **** of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was ************, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.  The circumstances ************ all this; the people ******** it; and there the child ******* on an *********, ********* enough even to ******* us, until a ***** lady, ********, then, at *******, saw the girl by ******, ****** her, and took her home.  There was some ****** *****, I think, against us; for in ***** of all our ******* she remained there and was happy.  I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.' 

'Do you see her now?' 

'Yes.  ******* on your arm.' 

'But not the less my *****,' cried Mrs. Maylie, ******* the ******** girl in her arms; 'not the less my ******* child.  I would not lose her now, for all the ********* of the world.  My sweet companion, my own dear girl!' 

'The only friend I ever had,' cried Rose, ******** to her. 'The *******, best of friends.  My heart will burst.  I cannot bear all 



'You have ***** more, and have been, through all, the best and ******** creature that ever **** happiness on every one she knew,' said Mrs. Maylie, ********* her ********. 'Come, come, my love, ******** who this is who ***** to ***** you in his arms, poor child!  See ****--****, look, my dear!' 

'Not ****,' cried Oliver, ******** his arms about her neck; 'I'll never call her ****--******, my own dear ******, that something ****** my heart to love so ****** from the first!  Rose, dear, ******* Rose!' 

Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were ********* in the long close ******* between the *******, be ******.  A father, ******, and mother, were ******, and lost, in that one moment.  Joy and ***** were ******* in the ***; but there were no ****** tears:  for even ***** itself ***** so ********, and ******* in such sweet and ****** *************, that it became a ****** pleasure, and lost all ********* of pain. 

They were a long, long time alone.  A **** *** at the door, at length ********* that some one was without.  Oliver opened it, ****** away, and gave place to Harry Maylie. 

'I know it all,' he said, taking a seat ****** the ****** girl. 'Dear Rose, I know it all.' 

'I am not here by ********,' he added after a ********** silence; 'nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it *********--**** *********.  Do you ***** that I have come to ****** you of a promise?' 

'****,' said Rose.  'You _do_ know all.' 

'All.  You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to ***** the subject of our last *********.' 

'I did.' 

'Not to ***** you to ***** your *************,' pursued the young man, 'but to hear you ****** it, if you would. I was to lay ******** of ******* or ******* I might ******* at your feet, and if you still ******* to your former *************, I ******* myself, by no word or ***, to **** to change it.' 

'The same ******* which ********** me then, will ********* me now,' said Rose firmly.  'If I ever **** a ****** and ***** **** to her, whose goodness ***** me from a life of ********* and *********, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?  It is a ********,' said Rose, 'but one I am ***** to make; it is a ****, but one my heart shall 



'The ********** of **-*****,'--***** began. 

'The ********** of to-night,' replied Rose softly, '****** me in the same position, with ********* to you, as that in which I stood before.' 

'You ****** your heart against me, Rose,' ***** her *****. 

'Oh Harry, Harry,' said the young lady, ******** into tears; 'I wish I could, and ***** myself this pain.' 

'Then why ******* it on yourself?' said Harry, taking her hand. 'Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.' 

'And what have I heard!  What have I heard!' cried Rose. 'That a sense of his deep ******** so ****** upon my own father that he ******* ***--*****, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.' 

'Not yet, not yet,' said the young man, ********* her as she rose.  'My *****, my ******, *********, feeling:  every thought in life except my love for you:  have ********* a change.  I ***** you, now, no *********** among a ******** crowd; no ******** with a world of ****** and **********, where the blood is called into ****** ****** by ***** but real ******** and *****; but a ****--* heart and ****--***, ******* Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to *****.' 

'What do you mean!' she ********. 

'I mean but ****--**** when I left you last, I left you with a **** ************* to ***** all ******* ******** between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be *****, I would make ***** mine; that no ***** of birth should **** the *** at you, for I would turn from it.  This I have done.  Those who have ****** from me because of this, have ****** from you, and ****** you so far right.  Such power and *********:  such ********* of ********* and ****:  as smiled upon me then, look ****** now; but there are smiling fields and ****** ***** in *******'* ******* ******; and by one ******* ******--****, Rose, my ***!--***** ****** a ****** ******** which you can make me ******* of, than all the ***** I have *********, ******** a ************.  This is my **** and ******* now, and here I lay it down!' 

      *      *      *      *      * 

'It's a ****** thing ******* ****** for ******,' said Mr. Grimwig, ****** up, and ******* his ******-************ from over his head. 

Truth to tell, the ****** had been ******* a most ************ time. Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could ***** a word in ***********. 

'I had ******* thoughts of ****** my head to-night,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'for I began to think I should get nothing else.  I'll take the *******, if you'll ***** me, of ******** the ***** that is to be.' 

Mr. Grimwig lost no time in ******** this notice into effect upon the ******** girl; and the *******, being **********, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people ****** that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, **********, in a dark room *********; but the best *********** ******** this ********* *******:  he being young and a 



'Oliver, my child,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'where have you been, and why do you look so ***?  There are tears ******** down your face at this moment.  What is the matter?' 

It is a world of **************:  often to the ***** we most *******, and ***** that do our nature the ******** honour. 

Poor **** was dead! 





CHAPTER *** 

*****'* LAST NIGHT ALIVE 

The ***** was *****, from floor to ****, with ***** faces. *********** and ***** eyes ****** from every **** of space. From the **** before the ****, away into the ******** ***** of the ******** corner in the *********, all looks were fixed upon one ***--*****.  Before him and behind:  above, below, on the right and on the left:  he seemed to stand ********** by a *********, all bright with ******** eyes. 

He stood there, in all this ***** of living light, with one hand ******* on the ****** **** before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to ****** him to ***** with ******* ************ every word that fell from the ********* *****, who was ********** his ****** to the ****.  At times, he turned his eyes ******* upon them to ******* the effect of the ********* ************* in his ******; and when the ****** against him were ****** with ******** ************, looked towards his *******, in **** ****** that he would, even then, **** something in his ******.  Beyond these ************** of *******, he ******* not hand or foot.  He had scarcely moved since the ***** began; and now that the ***** ****** to speak, he still remained in the same ******** attitude of close attention, with his **** **** on him, as though he listened still. 

A slight ****** in the *****, ******** him to himself.  Looking round, he saw that the ******* had turned together, to ******** their *******. As his eyes ******** to the *******, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face:  some hastily ******** their ******* to their eyes:  and others ********** their ********** with looks ********** of **********.  A few there were, who seemed ********* of him, and looked only to the ****, in ********* wonder how they could *****.  But in no one ****--*** even among the women, of whom there were many *****--***** he read the ******** ******** with himself, or any feeling but one of ***-********* interest that he should be 



As he saw all this in one ********** glance, the ********* ********* came again, and looking back he saw that the ******* had turned towards the *****.  Hush! 

They only ****** ********** to ******. 

He looked, *********, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the ******* number *****; but that was *********.  The ****** ******* him on the shoulder. He followed ************ to the end of the ****, and sat down on a chair.  The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it. 

He looked up into the ******* again.  Some of the people were ******, and some ******* themselves with *************; for the crowded place was very ***.  There was one young man ********* his face in a little ****-****.  He ******** whether it was like, and looked on when the ****** ***** his ******-*****, and made another with his *****, as any **** ********* might have done. 

In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the *****, his mind began to **** itself with the ******* of his *****, and what it ****, and how he put it on.  There was an old *** gentleman on the *****, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.  He ******** within himself whether this man had been to get his ******, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this ***** of ******** thought until some new object caught his eye and roused 



Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one ********** ************ sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a ***** and ******* way, and he could not *** his thoughts upon it.  Thus, even while he ********, and turned ******* *** at the **** of ****** death, he fell to ******** the iron ****** before him, and ********* how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would **** it, or leave it as it was.  Then, he thought of all the ******* of the ******* and the ********--*** stopped to watch a man ********** the floor to **** **--*** then went on to think again. 

At length there was a cry of silence, and a ********** look from all towards the door.  The **** returned, and passed him close. He could ***** nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. ******* ********* ******--*** a ******--*** a ******--******. 

The ******** **** with a ********** *****, and another, and another, and then it ****** loud ******, that ******** strength as they ******* out, like ***** *******.  It was a **** of joy from the ******** outside, ******** the **** that he would die on ******. 

The noise ********, and he was asked if he had anything to say why ******** of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his ********* attitude, and looked ******** at his ********** while the ****** was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old ***--** old ***--*** so, ******** into a whisper, was silent again. 

The ***** ******* the black ***, and the ******** still stood with the same air and *******.  A woman in the *******, uttered some ***********, called forth by this ***** *********; he looked hastily up as if ***** at the ************, and **** forward yet more ***********. The ******* was ****** and **********; the ******** ******* to hear. But he stood, like a ****** ******, without the ****** of a *****.  His ******* face was still thrust forward, his *****-*** ******* down, and his eyes ******* out before him, when the ****** put his hand upon his arm, and ******** him away.  He ***** ******** about him for an instant, and ******. 

They led him through a ***** room under the *****, where some ********* were ******* till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a ***** which looked into the open ****. There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the ********* fell back to ****** him more ******* to the people who were ******** to the ****:  and they ******** him with *********** *****, and ********* and ******.  He shook his ****, and would have **** upon them; but his ********** hurried him on, through a gloomy passage ******* by a few *** *****, into the ******** of the ******. 

Here, he was ********, that he might not have about him the means of ************ the ***; this ******** *********, they led him to one of the ********* *****, and left him *****--*****. 

He sat down on a stone ***** opposite the door, which ****** for seat and ********; and ******* his *****-**** eyes upon the ground, tried to ******* his thoughts. After ******, he began to ******** a few ********** ********* of what the ***** had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.  These gradually fell into their ****** ******, and by ******* ********* more:  so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was *********.  To be ****** by the neck, till he was ****--**** was the end.  To be ****** by the neck till he was dead. 

As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the ********; some of them through his means.  They rose up, in such quick **********, that he could hardly ***** them.  He had seen some of them ***,--*** had ***** too, because they died with ******* upon their lips.  With what a ******** noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and ******** men to ******** ***** of clothes! 

Some of them might have ********* that very ****--*** upon that very spot.  It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light?  The **** had been ***** for many years.  ****** of men must have passed their last hours there.  It was like sitting in a ***** ****** with dead ******--*** ***, the *****, the ******** arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that ******* ****.--*****, light! 

At length, when his hands were *** with ******* against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared:  one ******* a candle, which he thrust into an iron *********** fixed against the wall:  the other ******** in a ******** on which to **** the night; for the ******** was to be left alone no more. 

Then came the *****--****, ******, silent night.  Other ******** are glad to hear this ******-***** ******, for they tell of life and coming day.  To him they brought *******.  The **** of every iron bell came ***** with the one, deep, ****** *****--*****. What ******* the noise and ****** of ******** morning, which ********** even there, to him? It was another form of *****, with ******* added to the *******. 

The day passed off.  Day?  There was no day; it was gone as soon as ****--*** night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its ******** hours.  At one time he ***** and **********; and at another ****** and **** his hair. ********* men of his own ********** had come to pray ****** him, but he had ****** them away with ******.  They ******* their ********** *******, and he beat them off. 

******** night.  He had only one night more to live.  And as he thought of this, the day *****--******. 

It was not until the night of this last ***** day, that a ********* sense of his ********, desperate state came in its full ********* upon his ******** soul; not that he had ever held any ******* or ******** hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to ******** more than the *** *********** of ***** so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who ******** each other in their ********** upon him; and they, for their *****, made no effort to ***** his attention.  He had sat there, *****, but ********.  Now, he started up, every minute, and with ******* mouth and ******* ****, hurried to and fro, in such a ******** of fear and ***** that even ****--**** to such ******--******** from him with ******.  He grew so ********, at last, in all the ******** of his **** **********, that one man could not bear to sit there, ****** him alone; and so the two kept watch together. 

He ******* down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been ******* with some ******** from the crowd on the day of his *******, and his head was ******** with a ***** *****.  His red hair hung down upon his ********* face; his ***** was ****, and ******* into *****; his eyes ***** with a ******** light; his ******** ***** ******** with the fever that ***** him up. *****--****--****.  If it was not a ***** to ******** him, and those were the real hours ******** on each other's *****, where would he be, when they came round again! ******!  Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ****** to *******.  At *****, he would be the only ******* in his own ******* *****; at ******-- 

Those dreadful walls of *******, which have ****** so much misery and such *********** *******, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so ***** a ********* as that.  The few who ******** as they passed, and ******** what the man was doing who was to be ****** to-morrow, would have ***** but ill that night, if they could have seen him. 

From early in the evening until nearly ********, little ****** of two and three presented themselves at the *****-****, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any ******** had been received.  These being answered in the ********, ************ the ******* intelligence to ******** in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the ******** would be *****, and, walking with ********* steps away, turned back to ******* up the scene.  By ******* they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to ******** and darkness. 

The space before the ****** was *******, and a few strong ********, ******* black, had been already ****** across the road to ***** the ******** of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the ******, and presented an order of ********* to the ********, ****** by one of the ********.  They were immediately ******** into the 



'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?' said the man whose **** it was to ******* them.  'It's not a sight for children, sir.' 

'It is not indeed, my friend,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but my business with this man is ********** ********* with him; and as this child has seen him in the full ****** of his ******* and ********, I think it as ****--**** at the **** of some pain and ****--**** he should see him 



These few words had been said *****, so as to be ********* to Oliver. The man ******* his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some **********, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and ******* ****, towards the *****. 

'This,' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of ******* were making some ************ in ******** *******--'**** is the place he ****** through.  If you step this way, you can see the door he **** out at.' 

He led them into a stone kitchen, ****** with ******* for ******** the ****** ****, and pointed to a door.  There was an open ******* above it, through which came the sound of ***'* ******, ******* with the noise of *********, and the ******** down of ******.  There were putting up the ********. 

From this place, they passed through several strong *****, opened by other ******** from the ***** side; and, having entered an open ****, ******** a ****** of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a *** of strong ***** on the left hand.  ********* them to ****** where they were, the ******* ******* at one of these with his ***** of ****. The two **********, after a little **********, came out into the passage, ********** themselves as if glad of the ********* ******, and ******** the ******** to follow the ****** into the ****.  They did so. 

The ********* ******** was seated on his bed, ******* himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a ****** ***** than the face of a man.  His mind was ********* ********* to his old life, for he continued to ******, without ********* ********* of their presence ********* than as a part of his ******. 

'Good boy, *******--**** done--' he *******.  'Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver ***--***** the gentleman ***--***** ***--**** that boy away to 



The ****** took the ********** hand of Oliver; and, ********** him not to be *******, looked on without speaking. 

'Take him away to bed!' cried Fagin.  'Do you hear me, some of you?  He has been ***--***--******* the cause of all this.  It's worth the money to bring him up to **--******'* throat, Bill; never mind the ****--******'* throat as deep as you can cut.  Saw his head off!' 

'Fagin,' said the ******. 

'That's me!' cried the Jew, falling *********, into the attitude of ********* he had ******* upon his *****.  'An old man, my ****; a very old, old man!' 

'Here,' said the *******, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down.  'Here's somebody ***** to see you, to ask you some *********, I suppose.  Fagin, Fagin!  Are you a man?' 

'I ****'* be one long,' he replied, looking up with a face ********* no ***** expression but **** and ******.  '****** them all dead!  What right have they to ******* me?' 

As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. ********* to the ******** corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted 



'******,' said the *******, still ******* him down.  'Now, sir, tell him what you want.  Quick, if you please, for he ***** worse as the time **** on.' 

'You have some ******,' said Mr. Brownlow *********, 'which were placed in your hands, for better ********, by a man called Monks.' 

'It's all a lie together,' replied Fagin.  'I haven't ***--*** one.' 

'For the love of God,' said Mr. Brownlow ********, 'do not say that now, upon the very ***** of death; but tell me where they are.  You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has *********; that there is no hope of any further ****.  Where are those ******?' 

'Oliver,' cried Fagin, ********* to him.  'Here, here! Let me whisper to you.' 

'I am not afraid,' said Oliver in a low voice, as he ************ Mr. ********'* hand. 

'The ******,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in a ****** ***, in a **** a little way up the ******* in the top *****-****.  I want to talk to you, my dear.  I want to talk to you.' 

'Yes, yes,' returned Oliver.  'Let me say a ******.  Do!  Let me say one ******.  Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.' 

'Outside, outside,' replied Fagin, ******* the boy before him towards the door, and looking ******** over his head. 'Say I've gone to *****--****'** believe you.  You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!' 

'Oh!  God ******* this wretched man!' cried the boy with a burst of 



'That's right, that's right,' said Fagin.  '****'** help us on. This door first.  If I ***** and *******, as we **** the *******, don't you mind, but ***** on.  Now, now, now!' 

'Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?' inquired the *******. 

'No other question,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'If I ***** we could ****** him to a sense of his position--' 

'Nothing will do that, sir,' replied the man, shaking his head. 'You had better leave him.' 

The door of the **** opened, and the ********** returned. 

'***** on, ***** on,' cried Fagin.  'Softly, but not so ****. ******, 



The men laid hands upon him, and *********** Oliver from his *****, held him back.  He ********* with the power of ***********, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that ********** even those ******* walls, and **** in their ears until they reached the open ****. 

It was some time before they left the ******.  Oliver nearly ******* after this ********* scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk. 

Day was ******* when they again *******.  A great ********* had already *********; the windows were filled with people, ******* and ******* ***** to ******* the time; the crowd were *******, ***********, ******. Everything told of life and *********, but one dark ******* of ******* in the ****** of ***--*** black *****, the *****-****, the ****, and all the ******* ********* of death. 





CHAPTER **** 

AND LAST 

The ******** of those who have ******* in this **** are nearly closed. The little that ******* to their ********* to ******, is told in few and ****** words. 

Before three months had passed, Rose ******* and Harry Maylie were ******* in the ******* church which was ********** to be the scene of the young *********'* *******; on the same day they entered into ********** of their new and happy home. 

Mrs. Maylie took up her ***** with her *** and ********-**-***, to *****, during the ******** ********* of her days, the ******** ******** that age and worth can ****--*** ************* of the happiness of those on whom the ******* ********** and ********* ***** of a ****-***** life, have been *********** ********. 

It appeared, on full and ******* *************, that if the ***** of ******** ********* in the ******* of Monks (which had never ********* either in his hands or in those of his mother) were ******* ******* between himself and Oliver, it would *****, to each, little more than three ******** pounds.  By the ********** of his ******'* will, Oliver would have been ******** to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, ********* to ******* the ***** *** of the opportunity of ********** his former ***** and ******** an ****** ******, ******** this **** of ************, to which his young ****** ******** *******. 

Monks, still ******* that ******* name, ******* with his ******* to a ******* part of the New World; where, having quickly ********** it, he once more fell into his old *******, and, after ********** a long *********** for some fresh *** of ***** and *******, at length **** under an ****** of his old ********, and died in ******.  As far from home, died the ***** ********* ******* of his friend *****'* ****. 

Mr. Brownlow ******* Oliver as his ***.  ******** with him and the old *********** to within a **** of the *********-*****, where his dear friends *******, he ********* the only ********* wish of Oliver's **** and earnest heart, and thus ****** together a little society, whose condition ********** as nearly to one of ******* happiness as can ever be known in this ******** world. 

Soon after the ******** of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to ********, where, ****** of the presence of his old friends, he would have been ************ if his *********** had ******** of such a feeling; and would have turned quite ******* if he had known how.  For two or three months, he ********* himself with ******* that he ****** the air began to ******** with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he ******* his business on his *********, took a ********'* ******* outside the ******* of which his young friend was ******, and *************** *********.  Here he took to *********, ********, *******, ************, and various other ******** of a ******* kind:  all ********** with his ************** ***********.  In each and all he has since become ****** ********** the ************, as a most ******** *********. 

Before his *******, he had ******* to ******** a strong ********** for Mr. Grimwig, which that ********* gentleman ********* ************.  He is *********** ******* by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year.  On all such *********, Mr. Grimwig ******, ******, and **********, with great ******; doing everything in a very ******** and ************* manner, but always *********** with his ********* ************, that his **** is the right one.  On *******, he never ***** to ********* the ****** to the young *********'* face:  always ********* Mr. Losberne, in ****** ********** afterwards, that he ********* it an ********* ***********, but ***** it as well not to say so.  It is a standing and very ********* ****, for Mr. Brownlow to ***** him on his old ******** ********** Oliver, and to ****** him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, ******* his return; but Mr. Grimwig ******** that he was right in the ****, and, in proof *******, ******* that Oliver did not come back after all; which always ***** forth a laugh on his side, and ********* his good ******. 

Mr. Noah Claypole:  ********* a free ****** from the ***** in *********** of being ******** ******** against Fagin:  and *********** his ********** not ********** as safe a one as he could wish:  was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a **********, not ******** with too much work.  After some consideration, he went into business as an ********, in which ******* he ******** a ******* ***********.  His **** is, to walk out once a week during church time ******** by Charlotte in *********** ******.  The lady ****** away at the ***** of ********** *********, and the gentleman being ************ with *****-***** worth of ****** to ******* her, **** an *********** next day, and pockets half the *******.  Sometimes Mr. Claypole ****** himself, but the ****** is the same. 

Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, ******** of their **********, were gradually ******* to great ********* and misery, and ******* became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once ****** it over others. Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this ******* and ***********, he has not even spirits to be ******** for being ********* from his 



As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still ****** in their old *****, although the former is ****, and the ****-***** boy quite ****.  They sleep at the *********, but ****** their ********** so ******* among its *******, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the ********* have never been able to ******** to which ************* they ******** ******. 

Master ******* Bates, ******** by *****'* *****, fell into a ***** of ********** whether an ****** life was not, after all, the best. ******** at the ********** that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the ****** of the past, resolved to ***** it in some new ****** of action.  He ********* hard, and ******** much, for some time; but, having a ********* ***********, and a good purpose, ********* in the end; and, from being a ******'* ******, and a *******'* lad, he is now the ******** young ******* in all ****************. 

And now, the hand that ****** these words, *******, as it ********** the ********** of its ****; and would *****, for a little longer space, the ****** of these **********. 

I would **** ****** yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and ***** their happiness by ************ to ****** it.  I would show Rose Maylie in all the ***** and ***** of early *********, ******** on her ******** **** in life **** and gentle light, that fell on all who **** it with her, and ***** into their ******.  I would ***** her the life and joy of the ****-**** ****** and the ****** ****** *****; I would follow her through the ****** fields at ****, and hear the low ***** of her sweet voice in the ******* evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and ******* ******, and the smiling ******** ********* of ******** ****** at home; I would ***** her and her dead ******'* child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in ********* the friends whom they had so ***** lost; I would ****** before me, once again, those ****** little faces that ********* round her ****, and listen to their merry *******; I would ****** the ***** of that clear laugh, and ******* up the ************ **** that ********* in the **** **** eye.  These, and a ******** looks and ******, and turns of thought and ******--* would **** ****** them every one. 

How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, ******* the mind of his ******* child with ****** of *********, and ******** ******** to him, more and more, as his nature ********* itself, and showed the ******** ***** of all he ****** him to ******--*** he ****** in him new ****** of his early friend, that awakened in his own ***** old ************, ********** and yet sweet and ********--*** the two *******, tried by *********, ********** its ******* in mercy to others, and ****** love, and ******* ****** to Him who had ********* and ********* ****--***** are all matters which need not to be told.  I have said that they were ***** happy; and without strong ********* and ******** of heart, and ********* to that Being whose **** is Mercy, and whose great ********* is *********** to all things that *******, happiness can never be 



Within the ***** of the old ******* church there ****** a white ****** ******, which ***** as yet but one word:  '*****.'  There is no coffin in that ****; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it!  But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to ***** ***** ******** by the ****--*** love beyond the *****--** those whom they knew in life, I believe that the ***** of ***** sometimes ****** round that ****** ****. I believe it none the less because that **** is in a Church, and she was weak and ******.
