'Will she go with me?' inquired **** Oliver. 

'No, she ***'*,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'But ***'** come and see you 



This was no very great *********** to the child.  Young as he was, *******, he had ***** ****** to make a ***** of ******* great ****** at ***** away.  It was no very ********* ****** for the boy to **** ***** into his eyes.  ****** and ****** ***-***** are great ********** if you **** to ***; and Oliver cried very ********* ******.  Mrs. **** **** him a ******** ********, and what Oliver ****** a great **** more, a ***** of ***** and ******, **** he should **** too ****** when he got to the *********. With the ***** of ***** in his hand, and the little *****-***** ****** *** on his head, Oliver was then *** away by Mr. Bumble from the ******** **** where one **** **** or look had never ******* the ***** of his ****** *****.  And *** he ***** into an ***** of ******** *****, as the *******-**** ****** after him.  ******** as were the little ********** in ****** he was ******* ******, they were the only ******* he had **** *****; and a ***** of his ********** in the great **** *****, **** into the *****'* ***** for the first time. 

Mr. Bumble ****** on with long *******; little Oliver, ****** ******** his ****-***** ****, ******* ****** him, ********* at the *** of every ******* of a **** ******* they were '****** there.' To these ************** Mr. Bumble ******** very ***** and ******** *******; for the ********* ********* which ***-***-***** ******* in some ****** had by this time **********; and he was once again a ******. 

Oliver had not been ****** the ***** of the ********* a ******* of an ****, and had ******** ********* the ********** of a ****** ***** of *****, when Mr. Bumble, who had ****** him over to the **** of an old woman, ********; and, ******* him it was a ***** night, ******** him that the ***** had said he was to ****** before it *********. 

Not having a very ******* ******* ****** of what a **** ***** was, Oliver was ****** ********* by this ************, and was not ***** ******* ******* he ***** to ***** or ***.  He had no time to think about the ******, *******; for Mr. Bumble **** him a *** on the head, with his ****, to **** him up: and another on the back to make him ******: and ******* him to ******, ********* him into a ***** *****-****** room, where ***** or *** *** ********* were ******* round a *****.  At the *** of the *****, ****** in an ***-***** ****** ****** than the ****, was a ************ *** gentleman with a very round, *** 



'*** to the *****,' said Bumble.  Oliver ******* away two or ***** ***** that were ********* in his eyes; and ****** no ***** but the *****, *********** ***** to that. 

'****'* your ****, boy?' said the gentleman in the **** *****. 

Oliver was ********** at the ***** of so many *********, which made him *******: and the ****** **** him another *** ******, which made him ***.  These two ****** made him ****** in a very *** and ********** voice; ********* a gentleman in a ***** ********* said he was a ****. Which was a ******* way of ******* his *******, and ******* him ***** at his ****. 

'Boy,' said the gentleman in the **** *****, '****** to me. You know ***'** an ******, I *******?' 

'****'* that, sir?' inquired **** Oliver. 

'The boy _is_ a ****--* thought he was,' said the gentleman in the ***** *********. 

'****!' said the gentleman who had ****** first.  'You know ***'** got no ****** or ******, and that you were ******* up by the ******, don't 



'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, ******* ********. 

'What are you ****** for?' inquired the gentleman in the ***** *********.  And to be **** it was very *************.  What _could_ the boy be ****** for? 

'I **** you say your ******* every night,' said another gentleman in a ***** voice; 'and **** for the ****** who **** you, and take **** of ***--**** a *********.' 

'Yes, sir,' ********* the boy.  The gentleman who ***** **** was ************* *****.  It would have been very like a *********, and a ************ good ********* too, if Oliver had ****** for the ****** who *** and took **** of _him_. But he ****'*, ******* ****** had ****** him. 

'Well!  You have come here to be ********, and ****** a ****** *****,' said the ***-***** gentleman in the **** *****. 

'So ***'** ***** to **** ***** **-****** ******* at *** *'*****,' ***** the ***** one in the ***** *********. 

For the *********** of **** these ********* in the one ****** ******* of ******* *****, Oliver ***** *** by the ********* of the ******, and was then ******* away to a ***** ****; where, on a *****, **** ***, he ****** himself to *****.  What a ***** ************ of the ****** **** of *******!  They let the ******* go to *****! 

**** Oliver!  He little thought, as he *** ******** in ***** *************** of all ****** him, that the ***** had that very day ******* at a ******** which would ******** the most ******** ********* over all his ****** ********.  But they had.  And this was it: 

The ******* of this ***** were very ****, ****, ************* ***; and when they came to **** their ********* to the *********, they ***** out at once, what ******** ***** would never have **********--*** **** ****** ***** it!  It was a ******* place of ****** ************* for the ****** *******; a ****** where there was nothing to ***; a ****** *********, ******, ***, and ****** all the **** round; a ***** and ****** *******, where it was all **** and no ****.  '***!' said the *****, looking very *******; 'we are the ******* to *** this to ******; we'll **** it all, in no time.'  So, they *********** the ****, that all **** ****** should have the *********** (for they would ****** ******, not they), of being ******* by a ******* ******* in the house, or by a ***** one out of it.  With this ****, they ********** with the *****-***** to *** on an ********* ****** of *****; and with a ****-****** to ****** ************ ***** ********** of *******; and ****** ***** ***** of **** ***** a day, with an ***** ***** a ****, and **** a **** of *******.  They made a great many other **** and ****** ***********, having ********* to the ******, which it is not ********* to ******; ****** ********* to ******* **** ******* ******, in *********** of the great ******* of a **** in *******' *******; and, ******* of ********** a man to ******* his ******, as they had *********** done, took his ****** away from him, and made him a ********!  There is no ****** how many ********** for ******, ***** these **** two *****, might have ******* up in all ******* of *******, if it had not been ******* with the *********; but the ***** were ****-****** ***, and had ******** for this **********.  The ****** was *********** from the ********* and the *****; and that ********** 



For the first *** ****** after Oliver ***** was *******, the ****** was in **** *********.  It was ****** ********* at first, in *********** of the ******** in the **********'* ****, and the ********* of ****** in the ******* of all the *******, which ********* ******* on their ******, ******** *****, after a **** or ***'* *****.  But the ****** of ********* ******* got **** as well as the *******; and the ***** were in *********. 

The room in which the **** were ***, was a ***** ***** ****, with a ****** at one ***: out of which the ******, ******* in an ***** for the *******, and ******** by one or two *****, ****** the ***** at *********.  Of this ******* *********** **** boy had one *********, and no ****--****** on ********* of great ****** *********, when he had two ****** and a ******* of ***** *******. 

The ***** never ****** *******.  The **** ******** them with their ****** **** they ***** again; and when they had ********* this ********* (which never took very long, the ****** being ****** as ***** as the *****), they would *** ******* at the ******, with such ***** eyes, as if they could have ******** the very ****** of which it was ********; ********* **********, *********, in ******* their ******* most ***********, with the **** of ******** up any ***** ******** of ***** that might have been **** *******.  **** have ********* ********* *********. Oliver ***** and his ********** ******** the ******** of **** ********** for ***** ******: at **** they got so ********* and **** with ******, that one boy, who was **** for his ***, and ****'* been **** to that **** of ***** (for his ****** had **** a ***** ****-****), ****** ****** to his **********, that ****** he had another ***** of ***** *** ****, he was ****** he might some night ****** to *** the boy who ***** **** him, who ******** to be a ****** ***** of ****** ***.  He had a ****, ****** ***; and they ********** ******** him. A ******* was ****; **** were **** who should **** up to the ****** after ****** that *******, and *** for more; and it **** to Oliver *****. 

The ******* *******; the **** took their ******.  The ******, in his ****'* *******, ********* himself at the ******; his ****** ********** ****** ********** ****** him; the ***** was ****** out; and a long ***** was said over the ***** *******.  The ***** ***********; the **** ********* **** other, and ****** at Oliver; ***** his **** ********* ****** him.  Child as he was, he was ********* with ******, and ******** with ******.  He rose from the *****; and ********* to the ******, ***** and ***** in hand, said: ******** ******* at his own 



'******, sir, I **** some more.' 

The ****** was a ***, ******* man; but he turned very ****. He ***** in ********* ************ on the ***** ***** for some *******, and then ***** for ******* to the ******.  The ********** were ********* with ******; the **** with ****. 

'What!' said the ****** at ******, in a ***** voice. 

'******, sir,' replied Oliver, 'I **** some more.' 

The ****** ***** a **** at Oliver's head with the *****; ******** him in his ***; and ******** ***** for the ******. 

The ***** were ******* in ****** ********, when Mr. Bumble ****** into the room in great **********, and ********** the gentleman in the **** *****, said,

'For _more_!' said Mr. ********.  '******* ********, Bumble, and ****** me **********.  Do I ********** that he asked for more, after he had ***** the ****** ******** by the *******?' 

'He did, sir,' replied Bumble. 

'That boy will be ****,' said the gentleman in the ***** *********.  'I know that boy will be ****.' 

****** ************ the ********* *********'* *******.  An ******** ********** took place.  Oliver was ******* into ******* ***********; and a **** was **** ******* ****** on the ******* of the ****, ******** a ****** of **** ****** to ******* who would take Oliver ***** off the hands of the ******.  In other words, **** ****** and Oliver ***** were ******* to any man or woman who ****** an ********** to any *****, ********, or *******. 

'I never was more ********* of ******** in my life,' said the gentleman in the ***** *********, as he ******* at the **** and **** the **** **** *******: 'I never was more ********* of ******** in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be ****.' 

As I ******* to **** in the ****** ******* the ***** *********** gentleman was ***** or not, I should ******* *** the ******** of this ********* (********* it to ******* any at all), if I ******** to **** **** ***, ******* the life of Oliver ***** had this ******* *********** or no.

******* HOW OLIVER ***** WAS VERY **** ******* A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A ******** 

For a **** after the ********** of the ******* and ******* ******* of ****** for more, Oliver ******** a ***** ******** in the **** and ******** room to which he had been ********* by the ****** and ***** of the *****.  It *******, at first ***** not ************ to *******, that, if he had *********** a ******** ******* of ******* for the ********** of the gentleman in the ***** *********, he would have *********** that **** **********'* ********* *********, once and for ****, by ***** one *** of his ******-************ to a **** in the ****, and ********* himself to the other.  To the *********** of this ****, *******, there was one ********: ******, that ******-************* being ******* ******** of ******, had been, for all ****** ***** and ****, ******* from the ***** of ******* by the ******* ***** of the *****, in ******* *********: ******** ***** and ********** ***** their hands and *****.  There was a ***** ******* ******** in Oliver's ***** and ************.

Let it not be ******** by the ******* of 'the ******,' that, ****** the ****** of his ******** *************, Oliver was ****** the ******* of ********, the ******** of *******, or the ********** of ********* ***********.  As for ********, it was **** **** *******, and he was ******* to ******* his ********* every ******* ***** the ****, in a ***** ****, in the ******** of Mr. Bumble, who ********* his ******** ****, and ****** a ******** ********* to ******* his *****, by ******** ************ of the ****.

The ****** was in a ***** of ******** ***********: *********, ********, ******* he was ******** to be ******* with a *******-***** or two when he had ******** of the two ***** of **** with which the little **** was *****; so, without ******** the **** of *******, he ****** ******. 

Mr. ******** ******* a ****** *********** on the ****** *********, but more ************ on his eyes; and, ******* after him, ******** a **** on his head, which would ********** have ****** in any ***** but a ******'*.  Then, ******** **** of the ******, he **** his *** a ***** ******, by way of ****** ******** that he was not his own ******; and by these ***** turned him round.  He then **** him another **** on the head, **** to **** him **** he came back again.  Having ********* these ************, he ****** up to the ****, to **** the ****. 

The gentleman with the ***** ********* was ******** at the **** with his hands ****** him, after having ********* himself of some ******** ********** in the *****-****.

The more the **** ********* ****** to the *****, in this ***** of ****, the more ******** the ********** of the **** ********; so, they came to the ********** that the only way of ********* for Oliver ***********, was to **** him to *** without *****. 

Mr. Bumble had been ********** to make ******* *********** *********, with the **** of ******* out some ******* or other who ****** a *****-*** without any *******; and was ********* to the ********* to *********** the ****** of his *******; when he *********** at the ****, no **** a ****** than Mr. **********, the ********* **********.

As Mr. ********** said this, with the ******** *********** of an ***-**** man; and as Mr. Bumble **** that it ****** ****** to ****** a ********** on the ****** of the ******; the ****** gentleman thought it ********* to ****** the *******.  Oliver ***** being ********* in his mind, he made him his *****. 

'By the ***,' said Mr. Bumble, 'you don't know ******* who ***** a boy, do you?

'I *********,' said the **********. 'The **** ******* it in, "**** from ******** to the ****, and **** of the ****** *********** of life," ****'* they?' 

Mr. Bumble ******. 

'And they made it a ******* *******, I think,' said the **********, 'by ****** some words to the ******, that if the ********* ******* had--' 

'****!  *******!' ********** the ******.  'If the ***** ******** to all the ******** that ******** ******* ****, ****'* have ****** to do.' 

'Very ****,' said the **********; 'they would ******.'

'So they are,' said the **********. 

'They *****'* no more ********** *** ********* ******* about '** than that,' said the ******, ******** his ******* **************.

'And I only **** **'* a **** of the *********** ****, in the house for a **** or two,' said the ******; 'the ***** and *********** of the ***** would **** ***** their ****** down for '**.' 

'Let '** ***** for that,' replied the **********.  So ******, he ******, ***********: to **** the ****** ***** of the ********* ****** 



Mr Bumble ****** off his ****** ***; took a ************ from the ****** of the *****; ***** from his ******** the ************ which his **** had **********; ***** the ****** *** on again; and, ******* to the **********, said in a ****** voice: 

'Well; what about the boy?' 

'Oh!' replied the **********; 'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I *** a good **** ******* the ****'* *****.'

'Well,' replied the **********, 'I was ******** that if I *** so much ******* '**, *'** a ***** to *** as much out of '** as I can, Mr. Bumble; and **--* think I'll take the boy ******.' 

Mr. Bumble ******* the ********** by the ***, and *** him into the ********.  Mr. ********** was ******** with the ***** for **** *******; and it was ******** that Oliver should go to him that ******* 'upon ******'--* ****** which *****, in the **** of a ****** **********, that if the ****** ****, upon a ***** *****, that he can *** ****** **** out of a boy without ******* too much **** into him, he shall have him for a **** of *****, to do what he ***** with. 

When little Oliver was ***** before 'the *********' that *******; and ******** that he was to go, that night, as ******* *****-*** to a ******-*****'*; and that if he ********** of his *********, or **** came back to the ****** again, he would be **** to ***, there to be *******, or ******* on the head, as the **** might be, he ******* so little *******, that they by ****** ******* ********** him a ******** young ******, and ******* Mr. Bumble to ****** him *********. 

Now, ******** it was very ******* that the *****, of all ****** in the *****, should **** in a great ***** of ******** ************ and ****** at the ******** ****** of **** of ******* on the **** of *******, they were ****** out, in this ********** ********.  The ****** **** was, that Oliver, ******* of ********** too little *******, ********* ****** too much; and was in a **** way of being *******, for life, to a ***** of ****** ********* and ********** by the ill ***** he had ********. He ***** the **** of his ***********, in ******* *******; and, having had his ******* *** into his ****--***** was not very ********* to *****, ******** as it was all ********* ****** the ****** of a ***** ***** ******, about **** a **** ****** by ***** ****** ****--** ****** his *** over his eyes; and once more ********* himself to Mr. ******'* **** ****, was *** away by that ********* to a *** ***** of *********. 

For some time, Mr. Bumble **** Oliver *****, without ****** or ******; for the ****** ******* his head very *****, as a ****** ****** should: and, it being a ***** day, little Oliver was ********** ********** by the ****** of Mr. ******'* **** as they **** ****, and ********* to great ********* his ******* ********* and **** ***** ****-********.

'*** don't know who I am, I *******, ****'**?' said the *******-***, in ************: ********** from the *** of the ****, *********, with ******** *******. 

'No, sir,' ******** Oliver. 

'*'* ****** Noah ********,' said the *******-***, 'and ***'** ***** me. Take down the ********, *** **** young *******!' With this, Mr. ******** ************ a **** to Oliver, and ******* the **** with a ********* ***, which did him great ******.  It is ********* for a *****-******, *****-**** *****, of ********* make and ***** ***********, to look ********* ***** any *************; but it is more ********** so, when ********** to these ******** *********** are a *** **** and ****** ******. 

Oliver, having ***** down the ********, and ****** a **** of ***** in his ****** to ******* away ******* the ****** of the first one to a ***** ***** at the **** of the house in which they were **** ****** the day, was ********** ******** by Noah: who having ******** him with the ********* that '**'* ***** it,' ************ to **** him.  Mr. ********** came down **** after. ******* **********, Mrs. ********** ********.  Oliver having '****** it,' in ********** of ****'* **********, ******** that young gentleman down the ****** to *********. 

'Come **** the ****, Noah,' said *********.  'I ***** a **** little *** of ***** for you from ******'* *********.

'*'** hear, ****'**?' said Noah ********. 

'***, Noah!' said *********, 'what a *** ******** you are!  Why don't you let the boy *****?' 

'Let him *****!' said Noah.  'Why ********* **** him ***** ******, for the ****** of that.  ******* his ****** *** his ****** will **** ********* with him.  All his ********* let him have his own way ****** well.  **, *********?  He! he! he!' 

'Oh, you ***** ****!' said *********, ******** into a ****** *****, in which she was ****** by Noah; after which they **** looked ********** at **** Oliver *****, as he *** ********* on the *** in the ******* ****** of the room, and *** the ***** ****** which had been ********* ******** for him. 

Noah was a *******-***, but not a ********* ******.  No ******-***** was he, for he could ***** his ********* all the way back to his *******, who ***** **** by; his ****** being a ***********, and his ****** a ******* *******, ********** with a ****** ***, and a ******* ******* of ********-********* and an *********** ********.  The ****-**** in the ************* had long been in the ***** of ******** Noah in the ****** *******, with the *********** ******** of '********,' '*******,' and the like; and Noah had ****** them without *****.  But, now that ******* had **** in his way a ******** ******, at **** even the ******* could ***** the ****** of *****, he ******** on him with ********.  This ******* ******** **** for *************.  It ***** us what a ********* ***** ***** ****** may be made to be; and how *********** the same ******* ********* are ********* in the ****** **** and the ******** *******-***. 

Oliver had been ********** at the **********'* some ***** ***** or a *****.  Mr. and Mrs. **********--*** **** being **** **--**** ****** their ****** in the little ****-*******, when Mr. **********, after ******* *********** ******* at his ****, said, 

'My dear--'  He was ***** to say more; but, Mrs. ********** looking up, with a ********** ************ ******, he ******* *****. 

'Well,' said Mrs. **********, *******. 

'Nothing, my dear, nothing,' said Mr. **********. 

'***, you *****!' said Mrs. **********. 

'Not at all, my dear,' said Mr. ********** ******.  'I thought you ****'* **** to hear, my dear.  I was only ***** to say--' 

'Oh, don't tell me what you were ***** to say,' ********** Mrs. **********.  'I am ******; don't ******* me, ****.  _I_ don't **** to ******* upon your *******.'  As Mrs. ********** said this, she **** an ********** *****, which ********** ******* ************. 

'But, my dear,' said **********, 'I **** to *** your ******.' 

'No, no, don't *** ****,' replied Mrs. **********, in an ********* ******: '*** ******** ****'*.'  Here, there was another ********** *****, which ********** Mr. ********** very much.  This is a very ****** and ****-******** *********** ****** of *********, which is ***** very *********. It at once ******* Mr. ********** to *******, as a ******* ******, to be ******* to say what Mrs. ********** was most ******* to hear.  After a ***** ********, the ********** was most ********** ********. 

'It's only about young *****, my dear,' said Mr. **********. 'A very ****-******* boy, that, my dear.' 

'He **** be, for he **** ******,' ******** the lady. 

'*****'* an ********** of ********** in his face, my dear,' ******* Mr. **********, 'which is very ***********.  He would make a ********** ****, my ****.' 

Mrs. ********** looked up with an ********** of ************ **********.  Mr. ********** ******** it and, without ******** time for any *********** on the good ****'* ****, *********. 

'I don't **** a ******* **** to ****** *****-** ******, my dear, but only for ********'* ********.  It would be very *** to have a **** in **********, my dear.  You may ****** upon it, it would have a ****** 



Mrs. **********, who had a good **** of ***** in the *********** way, was much ****** by the ******* of this ****; but, as it would have been ************ her ******* to have said so, ***** ******** *************, she ****** inquired, with much *********, why such an ******* ********** had not ********* ****** to her *******'* mind before?  Mr. ********** ******* ********* this, as an ************ in his ***********; it was ******** **********, *********, that Oliver should be at once ********* into the ********* of the *****; and, with this ****, that he should ********* his ****** on the very **** ******** of his ******** being ********. 

The ******** was not long in ******.  **** an **** after ********* **** *******, Mr. Bumble ******* the ****; and ********** his **** ******* the *******, **** ***** his ***** ******** ******-****: from which he ******** a ***** ***** of *****, which he ****** over to **********. 

'***!' said the **********, ******** over it with a ****** ***********; 'an ***** for a ******, **?' 

'For a ****** first, and a ********* ******* **********,' replied Mr. Bumble, ********* the ***** of the ******** ******-****: which, like himself, was very *********. 

'******,' said the **********, looking from the ***** of ***** to Mr. Bumble.  'I never ***** the **** before.' 

Bumble ***** his head, as he replied, '********* ******, Mr. **********; very *********.  *****, too, *'* ******, sir.' 

'*****, **?' ********* Mr. ********** with a *****.  'Come, that's too 



'Oh, it's *********,' replied the ******.  '**********, Mr. **********!' 

'So it is,' ********** the **********. 

'We only ***** of the ****** the night before ****,' said the ******; 'and we *******'* have ***** ******** about them, then, only a woman who ****** in the same house made an *********** to the ********* ********* for them to **** the ********* ******* to see a woman as was very ***.

'Never did, sir!' ********** the ******.  'No, *** ****** never did; but now ***'* ****, **'** got to **** her; and that's the *********; and the ****** it's done, the better.' 

**** ******, Mr. Bumble *** on his ****** *** ***** **** first, in a ***** of ********* **********; and ******** out of the ****. 

'Why, he was so *****, Oliver, that he ****** even to *** after you!' said Mr. **********, looking after the ****** as he ****** down the

He *****'* ***** ***** the ******* to ****** from Mr. ******'* ******, *******; for that ***********, on **** the ********** of the gentleman in the ***** ********* had made a very ****** **********, thought that now the ********** had got Oliver upon ***** the ******* was better *******, ***** such time as he should be ****** ***** for ***** *****, and all ****** of his being ******** upon the hands of the ****** should be **** *********** and ******* ********. 

'Well,' said Mr. **********, ****** up his ***, 'the ****** this *** is done, the better.  Noah, look after the ****. Oliver, *** on your ***, and come with me.'  Oliver ******, and ******** his ****** on his ************ *******. 

They ****** on, for some time, through the most ******* and ******* ********* **** of the ****; and then, ******** down a ****** ****** more ***** and ********* than any they had *** ****** through, ****** to look for the house which was the ****** of their ******.  The ****** on ****** **** were **** and *****, but very old, and ******** by ****** of the ******* *****: as their ********* ********** would have ************ *******, without the ********** ********* ******** by the ******* ***** of the few *** and ***** who, with ****** **** and ****** **** *******, ************ ******* *****.  A great many of the ********* had ****-******; but these were **** ******, and ********** away; only the ***** ***** being *********.  Some ****** which had ****** ******** from *** and *****, were ********* from ******* into the ******, by **** ***** of **** ****** ******* the *****, and ****** ******* in the ****; but even these ***** **** ****** to have been ******** as the ******* ****** of some ********* ********, for many of the ***** ****** which ******** the place of door and ******, were ******** from their *********, to ****** an ******** **** ****** for the ******* of a ***** ****.  The ****** was ******** and ******. The very ****, which here and there *** ********** in its **********, were ******* with ******. 

There was ******* ******* *** ****-****** at the **** door where Oliver and his ****** *******; so, ******* his way ********** through the **** *******, and ******* Oliver **** ***** to him and not be ****** the ********** ******* to the *** of the first ****** of ******.  ********* ******* a door on the *******, he ****** at it with his ********. 

It was ****** by a young girl of ******** or ********.  The ********** at once *** ****** of what the room *********, to know it was the ********* to which he had been ********.  He ******* in; Oliver ******** him. 

There was no **** in the room; but a man was *********, ************, over the ***** *****.  An old woman, too, had ***** a *** ***** to the **** ******, and was ******* ****** him. There were some ****** ******** in another ******; and in a ***** ******, ******** the door, there *** upon the ******, ********* ******* with an old *******. Oliver ********* as he **** his eyes ****** the place, and ***** ************* ****** to his ******; for ****** it was ******* up, the boy **** that it was a ******. 

The ***'* face was **** and very ****; his **** and ***** were *******; his eyes were *********.  The old *****'* face was ********; her two ********* ***** ********* over her ***** ***; and her eyes were ****** and ********.  Oliver was ****** to look at ****** her or the man. They ****** so like the **** he had **** *******. 

'****** shall go **** her,' said the man, ******** ******** up, as the ********** ********** the ******. '**** back! **** you, **** back, if ***'** a life to ****!' 

'********, my good man,' said the **********, who was ****** well **** to ****** in all its ******.  '********!' 

'I tell you,' said the man:  ********* his hands, and ******** ********* on the *****,--'* tell you I ***'* have her *** into the ******.  She ******'* **** there.  The ***** would ***** ***--*** *** ***--*** is so **** away.' 

The ********** ******* no ***** to this ******; but ********* a **** from his ******, ***** down for a ****** by the **** of the ****.

I ***** it before the *** that *** it! They ******* her!'  He ****** his hands in his ****; and, with a **** ******, ****** ********** upon the *****: his eyes *****, and the **** ******** his ****. 

The ********* ******** cried ********; but the old woman, who had ******** ******** as ***** as if she had been ****** **** to all that ******, ******* them into *******.  Having ********** the ****** of the man who ***** ******** ******** on the ******, she ******** ******* the 



'She was my ********,' said the old woman, ******* her head in the ********* of the ******; and ******** with an ******* ****, more ******* than even the ******** of ***** in such a place. '****, ****! Well, it _is_ ******* that I who **** ***** to her, and was a woman then, should be ***** and ***** now, and she ***** there: so **** and *****!  ****, ****!--** think of it; it's as good as a ****--** good as a ****!' 

As the ******** ******** ******* and ******** in her ******* *********, the ********** turned to go away. 

'****, ****!' said the old woman in a **** *******.  'Will she be ****** **-******, or **** day, or **-*****?  I **** her out; and I must ****, you know.  **** me a ***** *****: a good **** one: for it is ****** ****.  We should have **** and ****, too, before we go!  Never mind; **** some *****--**** a **** of ***** and a *** of *****.  Shall we have some *****, dear?' she said *******: ******** at the **********'* ****, as he once more ***** ******* the door. 

'Yes, yes,' said the **********,'** ******.  ******** you like!' He ********** himself from the old *****'* *****; and, ******* Oliver after him, ******* away. 

The **** day, (the ****** having been ********* ******** with a ****-******** **** and a ***** of ******, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his ****** ******** to the ********* *****; where Mr. Bumble had ******* *******, *********** by **** *** from the *********, who were to *** as *******.  An old ***** ***** had been ****** over the **** of the old woman and the man; and the **** ****** having been ******* down, was ******* on the ********* of the *******, and ******* into the ******. 

'Now, you must *** your **** *** ********, old lady!' ********* ********** in the old *****'* ***; 'we are ****** ****; and it ***'* do, to **** the ********* *******.  **** on, my ***,--** ***** as you 



**** ********, the ******* ******* on ***** their ***** ******; and the two ******** **** as **** them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and ********** ****** at a good ***** **** in *****; and Oliver, ***** **** were not so long as his ******'*, *** by the ****. 

There was not so great a ********* for ******** as Mr. ********** had ***********, *******; for when they ******* the ******* ****** of the ********** in which the ******* ****, and where the ****** ****** were made, the ********* had not *******; and the *****, who was ******* by the ******-**** ****, ****** to think it by no ***** ********** that it might be an **** or so, before he came.  So, they *** the **** on the ***** of the *****; and the two ******** ****** ********* in the **** ****, with a **** **** ********* down, ***** the ****** **** **** the ********* had ********* into the ********** ****** a ***** **** at ****-***-**** ***** the **********, or ****** their ********** by ******* ********* and ******** over the ******.  Mr. ********** and Bumble, being ******** ******* of the *****, *** by the **** with him, and **** the *****. 

At ******, after a ***** of ********* more than an ****, Mr. Bumble, and **********, and the *****, were **** ******* ******* the *****. *********** **********, the ********* ********: ******* on his ******** as he came *****.  Mr. Bumble then ******** a boy or two, to **** up ***********; and the ******** gentleman, having **** as much of the ****** ******* as could be ********** into **** *******, **** his ******** to the *****, and ****** away again. 

'Now, ****!' said ********** to the *****-******. '**** up!' 

It was no very ********* ****, for the ***** was so ****, that the ********* ****** was ****** a few **** of the *******.  The *****-****** ********* in the *****; ******* it ******* down with his ****: ********** his *****; and ****** off, ******** by the ****, who ******** very **** ********** at the *** being over so ****. 

'Come, my good ******!' said Bumble, ******* the man on the back. 'They **** to **** up the ****.' 

The man who had never once *****, ***** he had ***** his ******* by the ***** ****, *******, ****** his head, ****** at the ****** who had ********* him, ****** ******* for a few *****; and **** down in a *****.  The ***** old woman was too much ******** in ********* the **** of her ***** (which the ********** had ***** off), to *** him any *********; so they ***** a can of **** ***** over him; and when he came to, *** him ****** out of the **********, ****** the ****, and ******** on their ********* ****. 

'Well, Oliver,' said **********, as they ****** ****, 'how do you like 



'****** well, ***** you, sir' replied Oliver, with ************ **********.  'Not very much, sir.' 

'**, ***'** *** **** to it in time, Oliver,' said **********. 'Nothing when you _are_ **** to it, my boy.' 

Oliver ********, in his own mind, ******* it had ***** a very long time to *** Mr. ********** **** to it.  But he thought it better not to *** the ********; and ****** back to the ****: ******** over all he had **** and *****.

OLIVER, BEING ****** BY THE ****** OF NOAH, ****** INTO ******, AND ****** ********** HIM 

The *****'* ***** over, Oliver was ******** ***********.  It was a **** ****** ****** **** at this time.  In ********** ******, ******* were looking up; and, in the ****** of a few *****, Oliver ******** a great **** of **********.  The ******* of Mr. **********'* ********* ***********, ******** even his most ******** *****.  The ****** *********** *********** no ****** at which ******* had been so *********, or so ***** to ****** *********; and many were the ******** *********** which little Oliver ******, in a ***-**** ******** down to his *****, to the ************* ********** and ******* of all the ******* in the ****.  As Oliver *********** his ****** in most of his ***** *********** too, in ***** that he might ******* that ********** of ********* and **** ******* of ***** which was ********* to a ******** **********, he had many ************* of ********* the ********* *********** and ********* with which some ******-****** ****** **** their ****** and ******. 

For ********; when ********** had an ***** for the ****** of some **** old lady or gentleman, who was ********** by a great ****** of ******* and ******, who had been ********* ************ ****** the ******** *******, and ***** ***** had been ****** ************* even on the most ****** *********, they would be as ***** ***** ********** as **** **--***** ******** and *********--********** ******** with as much ******* and ******, as if nothing ******** had ******** to ******* them.  ********, too, **** the **** of their ***** with the most ****** ********. *****, again, *** on ***** for their ********, as if, so *** from ******** in the **** of ******, they had made up their ***** to ****** it as ******** and ********** as ********.  It was **********, too, that ****** and ********* who were in ******** of ******* ****** the ******** of *********, ********* ****** as **** as they ******* ****, and ****** ***** ******** before the ***-******** was over.  All this was very ******** and ********* to see; and Oliver ****** it with great **********. 

That Oliver ***** was ***** to *********** by the ******* of these good ******, I ******, ******** I am his **********, ********* to ****** with any ****** of **********; but I can most ********** say, that for many ****** he ********* ****** to ****** to the ********** and ***-********* of Noah ********: who **** him *** ***** than before, now that his ******** was ****** by ****** the *** boy ******** to the ***** ***** and *******, ***** he, the old one, ******** ********** in the ******-*** and ********.  ********* ******* him ill, ******* Noah did; and Mrs. ********** was his ******* *****, ******* Mr. ********** was ******** to be his ******; so, ******* these ***** on one ****, and a **** of ******** on the other, Oliver was not ********** as *********** as the ****** *** was, when he was **** up, by *******, in the ***** ********** of a *******. 

And now, I come to a very ********* ******* in Oliver's *******; for I have to ****** an ***, ****** and *********** ******* in **********, but which ********** ******** a ******** ****** in all his ****** ********* and ***********. 

One day, Oliver and Noah had ********* into the ******* at the ***** ******-****, to ******* upon a ***** ***** of ******--* ***** and a **** of the ***** *** of the ****--**** ********* being ****** out of the way, there ****** a ***** ******** of time, which Noah ********, being ****** and *******, ********** he could not ******** ****** to a ******** ******* than *********** and *********** young Oliver *****. 

****** upon this ******** *********, Noah *** his **** on the *****-*****; and ****** Oliver's ****; and ******** his ****; and ********* his ******* that he was a '*****'; and *********** ********* his ********* of ****** to see him ******, ******** that ********* ***** should take place; and ******* upon ******* ****** of ***** *********, like a ********* and ***-*********** *******-*** as he was. But, ****** Oliver ***, Noah ********* to be more ********* *****; and in his *******, did what many ********* do to this day, when they **** to be *****.  He got ****** ********. 

'****'**,' said Noah, '***'* your ******?' 

'***'* ****,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say ******** about her to me!' 

Oliver's ****** rose as he said this; he ******** *******; and there was a ******* ******* of the ***** and ********, which Mr. ******** thought must be the ********* ********* of a ******* *** of ******. ***** this ********** he ******** to the ******. 

'What did she *** of, ****'**?' said Noah. 

'Of a ****** *****, some of *** old ****** **** me,' replied Oliver: more as if he were ******* to himself, than ********* Noah. 'I think I know what it must be to *** of that!' 

'*** ** *** *** ***, ***** *** *****, ****'**,' said Noah, as a **** ****** down Oliver's *****.  '****'* *** you a ********** now?' 

'Not _you_,' replied Oliver, *******. 'There; that's ******. Don't say ******** more to me about her; ***'* better not!' 

'Better not!' ********* Noah. 'Well!  Better not!  ****'**, don't be ********.  _Your_ ******, too!  She was a **** '** she was.  Oh, ***!' And here, Noah ****** his head ************; and ****** up as much of his ***** *** **** as ******** ****** could ******* ********, for the 



'*** know, ****'**,' ********* Noah, ********** by Oliver's *******, and ******** in a ******* **** of ******** ****: of all ***** the most ********: '*** know, ****'**, it ***'* be ****** now; and of ****** *** ******'* **** it then; and I am very ***** for it; and *'* **** we all are, and **** *** very much.  But *** must know, ****'**, *** ****** was a ******* *****-**** *** '**.' 

'What did you say?' inquired Oliver, looking up very *******. 

'A ******* *****-**** *** '**, ****'**,' replied Noah, ******. 'And it's a great **** better, ****'**, that she **** when she did, or **** ***'* have been **** ********* in *********, or ***********, or ****; which is more ****** than ******, ***'* it?' 

******* with ****, Oliver ******* up; ********* the ***** and *****; ****** Noah by the ******; ***** him, in the ******** of his ****, **** his ***** ********* in his head; and ********** his ***** ***** into one ***** ****, ****** him to the ******. 

A ****** ***, the boy had looked the ***** child, ****, ******** ******** that ***** ********* had made him.  But his ****** was ****** at ****; the ***** ****** to his **** ****** had *** his ***** on ****. His ****** ******; his ******** was *****; his *** ****** and *****; his ***** ****** *******, as he ***** ******* over the ******** ********* who now *** ********* at his ****; and ****** him with an ****** he had never ***** before. 

'**'** ****** me!' ********* Noah.  '*********!  ******!  ****'* the *** boy a ********* of me!  ****! ****!  Oliver's **** ***!

'Oh, you little ******!' ******** *********: ******* Oliver with her ****** *****, which was about ***** to that of a ********** ****** man in ************ good ********.  'Oh, you little **-*****-***, ***-**-****, ***-*** *******!'  And ******* every ********, ********* **** Oliver a **** with all her might: ************ it with a ******, for the ******* of *******. 

*********'* **** was by no ***** a ***** one; but, **** it should not be ********* in ******* Oliver's *****, Mrs. ********** ******* into the *******, and ******** to **** him with one hand, ***** she ********* his face with the other. In this ********** ******** of *******, Noah rose from the ******, and ********* him ******. 

This was ****** too ******* ******** to **** long.  When they were all ******* out, and could **** and **** no ******, they ******* Oliver, ********** and ********, but nothing *******, into the ****-******, and there ****** him up.  This being done, Mrs. ********** **** into a *****, and ***** into *****. 

'***** her, ***'* ***** off!' said *********.  'A ***** of *****, Noah, dear.  Make *****!' 

'Oh!  *********,' said Mrs. **********:  ******** as well as she could, through a ********** of ******, and a *********** of **** *****, which Noah had ****** over her head and *********.  'Oh! *********, what a ***** we have not all been ******** in *** ****!'

Noah ******* to make no *****, but ******* off at his ******* *****; and very much it ********** the ****** who were out *******, to see a *******-*** ******* through the ******* ****-****, with no *** on his head, and a *****-***** at his ***.

OLIVER ********* ********** 

Noah ******** *** ***** the ******* at his ******** ****, and ****** not once for ******, ***** he ******* the *********-****. Having ****** here, for a ****** or so, to ******* a good ***** of **** and an ******** **** of ***** and ******, he ******* ****** at the ******; and ********* such a ****** face to the **** ****** who ****** it, that even he, who *** nothing but ****** ***** about him at the **** of *****, ******* back in ************. 

'Why, ****'* the ****** with the boy!' said the old ******. 

'Mr. Bumble!

'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!' said Noah:  'Oliver, ***,--****** has--'

The ********** of Mrs. ********** to Oliver, had ********* of a ******* ******** upon him of all the ***** **** and **** which ****** **** would ***; so there was a great **** of ******** and ****-******** in her *********** ********* ***** Mr. ******'* ***** **********.  Of which, to do her *******, she was ****** ********, in thought, ****, or

'She did,' said Mrs. **********. 

'It's a ***!' said Oliver. 

Mrs. ********** ***** into a ***** of *****. 

This ***** of ***** left Mr. ********** no ***********.  If he had ********* for one ******* to ****** Oliver most ********, it must be ***** ***** to every *********** ****** that he would have been, ********* to all ********** in ******** of ********* ***********, a *****, an ********* *******, an ********* ********, a **** ********* of a man, and ******* other ********* ********** too ******** for ******* ****** the ****** of this *******.

The ***** of *****, *******, left him no ********; so he at once **** him a ********, which ********* even Mrs. ********** *******, and ******** Mr. ******'* ********** *********** of the ********* ****, ****** ***********.  For the **** of the day, he was **** up in the back *******, in ******* with a **** and a ***** of *****; and at night, Mrs. **********, after ****** ******* ******* ******* the door, by no ***** ************* to the ****** of his ******, looked into the room, and, ****** the ***** and ********* of Noah and *********, ******* him ******** to his ****** ***. 

It was not ***** he was left ***** in the ******* and ********* of the ****** ******** of the **********, that Oliver **** way to the ******** which the ***'* ********* may be ******** ****** to have ******** in a **** child.

But now, when there were **** to see or hear him, he **** upon his ***** on the *****; and, ****** his face in his hands, **** such ***** as, *** **** for the ****** of *** ******, few so young may **** have ***** to **** out before him! 

For a long time, Oliver ******** ********** in this ********. The ****** was ******* *** in the ****** when he rose to his ****. Having ***** ********** round him, and ******** ********, he ****** ***** the ********** of the door, and looked ******. 

It was a ****, **** night.

He ******* the house.  There was no ********** of its ******* ******** at that ***** ****.  Oliver *******, and ****** into the ******.  A child was ******* one of the little ****; as he *******, he ****** his **** face and ********* the ******** of one of his ****** **********. Oliver **** **** to see him, before he ****; for, ****** ******* than himself, he had been his little ****** and ********.

'****, ****!' said Oliver, as the boy *** to the ****, and ****** his **** *** ******* the ***** to ***** him.  'Is any one up?' 

'****** but me,' replied the child. 

'You ****'* say you *** me, ****,' said Oliver.  'I am ******* away. They **** and ***-*** me, ****; and I am ***** to **** my *******, some long way off.  I don't know where.  How **** you are!' 

'I ***** the doctor tell them I was *****,' replied the child with a ***** *****.  'I am very **** to see you, dear; but don't ****, don't 



'Yes, yes, I will, to say ****-*'** to you,' replied Oliver. 'I shall see you again, ****.  I know I shall!  You will be well and *****!'

OLIVER ***** TO ******.  HE ********** ON THE **** A ******* **** OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN 

Oliver ******* the ***** at which the **-**** **********; and once more ****** the ****-****.  It was ***** *'***** now. ****** he was ****** **** ***** away from the ****, he ***, and *** ****** the ******, by *****, **** ****: ******* that he might be ******* and *********.  Then he *** down to **** by the **** of the *********, and ***** to think, for the first time, where he had better go and *** to ****. 

The ***** by which he was ******, ****, in ***** **********, an ********** that it was **** ******* ***** from that **** to ******. The **** ******** a *** ***** of ***** in the ***'* mind.

He had ***** ***** the old *** in the *********, too, say that no *** of ****** **** **** in ******; and that there were **** of ****** in that **** ****, which ***** who had been **** up in ******* ***** had no **** of.  It was the very place for a ******** boy, who must *** in the ******* ****** some one ****** him. As these ****** ****** through his ********, he ****** upon his ****, and again ****** *******. 

He had ********** the ******** ******* himself and ****** by **** **** ***** more, before he *********** how much he must ******* *** he could **** to ***** his place of ***********. As this ************* ****** ****** upon him, he ********* his **** a little, and ********* upon his ***** of ******* there.  He had a ***** of *****, a ****** *****, and two ***** of *********, in his ******.  He had a ***** ***--* **** of **********'* after some ******* in which he had ********* himself more than ********** ****--** his ******. 'A ***** *****,' thought Oliver, 'is a very *********** *****; and so are two ***** of ****** *********; and so is a *****; but they are ***** ***** to a *****-**** *****' **** in ****** time.'  But Oliver's ********, like ***** of most other ******, ******** they were ********* ***** and ****** to ***** out his ************, were ****** at a **** to ******* any ******** **** of *********** them; so, after a good **** of ******** to no ********** *******, he ******* his little ****** over to the other ********, and ******* on. 

Oliver ****** ****** ***** that day; and all that time ****** nothing but the ***** of *** *****, and a few ******** of *****, which he ****** at the *******-***** by the ****-****.  When the night came, he turned into a ******; and, ******** ***** ***** a ***-****, ********** to *** there, **** *******.  He **** ********** at first, for the **** ****** ******** over the ***** ******: and he was **** and ******, and more ***** than he had **** **** before.  Being very ***** with his ****, *******, he **** **** ****** and ****** his ********. 

He **** **** and *****, when he got up **** *******, and so ****** that he was ******* to ******** the ***** for a ***** ****, in the very first ******* through which he ******.  He had ****** no more than ****** *****, when night ****** in again. His **** were ****, and his **** so **** that they ******** ******* him.  Another night ****** in the ***** **** ***, made him *****; when he *** ******* on his ******* **** ******* he could ****** ***** *****. 

He ****** at the ****** of a ***** **** **** a *****-***** came up, and then ****** of the ******* **********; but there were very few who took any ****** of him: and even ***** **** him to **** **** they got to the *** of the ****, and then let them see how *** he could *** for a *********.  **** Oliver ***** to **** up with the ***** a little way, but was ****** to do it, by ****** of his ******* and **** ****.  When the ******** *** this, they *** their ********* back into their ******* again, ********* that he was an **** young ***, and ****'* ******* ********; and the ***** ******* away and left only a ***** of **** 



In some ********, ***** ******* ****** were ***** up: ******* all ******* who ****** ****** the ********, that they would be **** to ****.  This ********** Oliver very much, and made him **** to *** out of ***** ******** with all ******** **********.  In ******, he would ***** about the ***-*****, and look ********** at every one who ******: a ********** which ********* ********** in the ********'* ******** one of the ****-**** who were ******** about, to ***** that ******* boy out of the place, for she was **** he had come to ***** *********.  If he ****** at a ******'* house, *** to one but they ********** to *** the *** on him; and when he ****** his **** in a ****, they ****** about the ******--***** ******* Oliver's ***** into his *****,--**** ***** the only ***** he had there, for many ***** ********. 

In ****, if it had not been for a ****-******* ********-***, and a ********** old lady, Oliver's ******** would have been ********* by the very same ******* which had *** an *** to his ******'*; in other words, he would most ********* have ****** **** upon the ****'* *******.  But the ********-*** **** him a **** of ***** and ******; and the old lady, who had a *********** ******** ********* ******** in some ******* **** of the *****, took **** upon the **** ******, and **** him what little she could ******--*** ****--**** such **** and ****** words, and such ***** of ******** and **********, that they **** ****** into Oliver's ****, than all the ********** he had **** *********.

The ******-******** were ******; the ****** was *****; not a **** had ******** to the ******** of the day.  The *** was ****** in all its ******** ******; but the ***** only ****** to **** the boy his own ************ and **********, as he ***, with ******** **** and ******* with ****, upon a ****-****. 

By *******, the ******** were ******; the ******-****** were ***** up; and ****** ***** ******* to and ***.  Some few ******* to **** at Oliver for a ****** or two, or turned round to ***** at him as they ******* by; but **** ******** him, or ******** ********** to ******* how he came there. He had no ***** to ***. And there he ***. 

He had been ********* on the **** for some time: ********* at the great ****** of ******-****** (every other house in ****** was a ******, ***** or *****), ****** ********** at the ******* as they ****** through, and ******** how ******* it ****** that they could do, with ****, in a few *****, what it had ***** him a ***** **** of ******* and ************* ****** his ***** to **********: when he was ****** by ********* that a boy, who had ****** him ********** some ******* before, had ********, and was now ********* him most ********* from the ******** **** of the way.  He took little **** of this at first; but the boy ******** in the same ******** of ***** *********** so long, that Oliver ****** his head, and ******** his ****** look.  Upon this, the boy ******* over; and ******* ***** up to Oliver, said, 

'*****, my *****!  ****'* the ***?' 

The boy who ********* this ******* to the young ********, was about his own ***: but one of the ******** looking **** that Oliver had even ****.  He was a ****-*****, ****-******, ******-***** boy ******; and as ***** a ******** as one would **** to see; but he had about him all the **** and ******* of a man.  He was ***** of his ***: with ****** ***-****, and little, *****, **** eyes.  His *** was ***** on the *** of his head so *******, that it ********** to **** off every ******--*** would have done so, very *****, if the ****** had not had a ***** of every now and then ****** his head a ****** ******, which ******* it back to its old place again.  He **** a ***'* ****, which ******* ****** to his *****.  He had turned the ***** back, ****-*** up his ***, to *** his hands out of the *******: ********** with the ******** **** of ********* them into the ******* of his ******** ********; for there he **** them.  He was, **********, as ********** and ********** a young gentleman as **** ***** **** **** ***, or ********* ****, in the ********. 

'*****, my *****!  ****'* the ***?' said this ******* young gentleman to Oliver. 

'I am very ****** and *****,' replied Oliver: the ***** ******** in his eyes as he *****. 'I have ****** a long way.  I have been ******* these ***** ****.' 

'******* for ***** ****!' said the young gentleman.  'Oh, I see. ****'* *****, **?  But,' he *****, ******** Oliver's look of ********, 'I ******* you don't know what a **** is, my ***** ***-***-*-**.' 

Oliver ****** replied, that he had ****** ***** a ****'* ***** ********* by the **** in ********. 

'My eyes, how *****!' ********* the young gentleman. 'Why, a ****'* a ******'****; and when you **** by a ****'* *****, it's not ******** ******, but ****** ****** up, and ***** a ****** down ****.  Was you never on the ****?' 

'What ****?' inquired Oliver. 

'What ****!  Why, _the_ ****--*** **** as ***** up so little room that **'** **** ****** a ***** ***; and ****** **** better when the ****'* *** with ******, than when it's ****; **** then they ***'* *** *******.

'Do you **** in ******?' inquired Oliver. 

'Yes. I do, when *'* at ****,' replied the boy. 'I ******* you **** some place to ***** in **-*****, don't you?' 

'I do, ******,' ******** Oliver. 'I have not ***** ***** a **** ***** I left the *******.' 

'Don't **** your ******* on that *****,' said the young gentleman. '*'** got to be in ****** **-*****; and I know a '********* old gentleman as ***** there, ***'** **** you ******** for *******, and never *** for the ******--**** is, if any ******** he ***** ********** you. And don't he know me?  Oh, no! Not in the *****!  By no *****. ********* not!' 

The young gentleman ******, as if to ******** that the ****** ********* of ********* were ********* ********; and ******** the **** as he did 



This ********** ***** of ******* was too ******** to be ********; ********** as it was *********** ******** up, by the ********* that the old gentleman ******** to, would ********* ******* Oliver with a *********** place, without **** of time.  This *** to a more ******** and ************ ********; from which Oliver ********** that his ******'* **** was **** *******, and that he was a ******** *** and ******* of the ******* gentleman before *********.

******** Oliver had ****** to ****** his ********* in ******* ***** of his ******, he could not **** ********* a few ***** ******* on ****** **** of the way, as he ****** *****.  A ******* or more ******** place he had never ****.  The ****** was very ****** and *****, and the *** was *********** with ****** ******. 

There were a good many ***** *****; but the only ***** in ***** ******** to be ***** of ********, who, even at that time of night, were ******** in and out at the *****, or ********* from the ******.

The Jew *******; and, ****** a *** ********* to Oliver, took him by the hand, and ***** he should have the ****** of his ******** ************. Upon this, the young gentleman with the ***** came round him, and ***** **** his hands very ****--********** the one in which he **** his little ******.

********** ******* *********** ********** THE ******** OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS ******* ****** 

It was **** **** ******* when Oliver *****, from a *****, long *****. There was no other ****** in the room but the old Jew, who was ******* some ****** in a ******** for *********, and ********* ****** to himself as he ******* it round and round, with an **** *****. He would **** every now and then to ****** when there was the ***** ***** *****: and when he had ********* himself, he would go on ********* and ******** again, as before. 

******** Oliver had ****** himself from *****, he was not ********** *****. There is a ****** *****, ******* ******** and ******, when you ***** more in **** ******* with your eyes **** ****, and ******** **** ********* of ********** that is ******* ****** you, than you would in **** ****** with your eyes **** ******, and your ****** ***** in ******* ***************. At such time, a ****** ***** **** ****** of what his mind is *****, to **** some ********** ********** of its ****** ******, its ******** from ***** and ******** time and *****, when ***** from the ********* of its ********* *********. 

Oliver was ********* in this *********. He *** the Jew with his ****-****** eyes; ***** his *** *********; and ********** the ***** of the ***** ******* ******* the ********'* *****: and *** the ****-**** ****** were ******** *******, at the same time, in **** ****** with ****** ********* he had **** *****. 

When the ****** was done, the Jew **** the ******** to the ***. ********, then in an ********** ******** for a few *******, as if he did not well know how to ****** himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and ****** him by his ****. He did not ******, and was to all *********** ******. 

After ********** himself upon this head, the Jew ******* ****** to the door: which he ********. He then **** *****: as it ****** to Oliver, from some **** in the *****: a ***** ***, which he ****** ********* on the *****. His eyes ********* as he ****** the ***, and looked in. ******** an old ***** to the *****, he *** down; and took from it a *********** **** *****, ********* with ******. 

'***!' said the Jew, ********* up his *********, and ********** every ******* with a ******* ****. '****** ****! ****** ****! ******* to the ****! Never **** the old ****** where they were. Never ******* upon old Fagin! And why should they? It ******'* have ******** the ****, or **** the **** up, a ****** ******. No, no, no! **** *******! **** *******!' 

With these, and other ******** *********** of the like ******, the Jew once more ********* the ***** in its place of ******. At ***** **** a ***** more were ********* ***** ***** from the same ***, and ******** with ***** ********; ******* *****, ********, *********, and other ******** of *********, of such *********** *********, and ****** ***********, that Oliver had no ****, even of their *****. 

Having ******** these ********, the Jew took out another: so ***** that it *** in the **** of his hand. There ****** to be some very ****** *********** on it; for the Jew **** it **** upon the *****, and ******* it with his hand, ***** over it, long and *********. At ****** he *** it down, as if ********** of *******; and, ******* back in his *****, 



'What a **** ***** ******* ********** is! **** *** never ******; **** *** never ***** ******* ******* to *****. **, it's a **** ***** for the *****! **** of '** ****** up in a ***, and **** left to **** *****, or **** *****-*******!' 

As the Jew ******* these words, his ****** **** eyes, which had been ******* ******** before him, **** on Oliver's face; the ***'* eyes were ***** on his in **** **********; and ******** the *********** was only for an *******--*** the ******** ***** of time that can ******** be *********--** was ****** to **** the old man that he had been ********. 

He ****** the *** of the *** with a **** *****; and, ****** his hand on a ***** ***** which was on the *****, ******* ********* up. He ******** very much ******; for, even in his ******, Oliver could see that the ***** ******** in the ***. 

'****'* that?' said the Jew. 'What do you ***** me for? Why are you *****? What have you ****? ***** out, boy! *****--*****! for your life. 

'I ****'* **** to ***** any ******, sir,' replied Oliver, ******. 'I am very ***** if I have ********* you, sir.' 

'You were not ***** an **** ***?' said the Jew, ******** ******** on the boy. 

'No! No, ******!' replied Oliver. 

'Are you ****?' cried the Jew: with a ***** ******* look than before: and a *********** ********.

Oliver **** up the ****** of the ****** with one hand, as he had **** the Dodger **** it, and **** the ************ ******* out of it with the other.

Oliver ******* himself of the **** **********, and **** to the ***** in a ******** ***.  The *** in the ****** looked at **** other, but no one ***** to ****.

And then ******** a **** *********** of Oliver's *****, ******, **********, and *************:  with the **** and ******* of Mr. Brownlow at **** ******.

'Of ******,' ******** Mr. ******* ***** to his ******, 'I **** he was. A ****** all over!' 

Mr. Brownlow ****** ***** his head to ****** ******* on his ******, and 



'Do you know where this **** boy is now?' 

'No more than ******,' replied Mr. Bumble. 

'Well, what DO you know of him?' inquired the old gentleman. '***** out, my ******, if you have ******** to say.  What DO you know of him?' 

'You don't ****** to know any good of him, do you?' said Mr. *******, ***********; after an ********* ******* of Mr. ******'* ********.

'I **** it is all too ****,' said the old gentleman ***********, after looking over the ******.  'This is not much for your ************; but I would ****** have ***** you ****** the *****, if it had been ********** to the boy.' 

It is not ********** that if Mr. Bumble had been ********* of this *********** at an ******* ****** of the *********, he might have ******** a very ********* ********* to his little *******.

'I tell you he is,' ******** the old gentleman.  'What do you **** by ***'* be?  We have **** ***** a **** ******* of him from his *****; and he has been a ********-***** little *******, all his life.' 

'I never will ******* it, sir,' replied the old lady, ******. 'Never!'

HOW OLIVER ****** HIS TIME IN THE ********* ******* OF HIS ********* 



About **** **** day, when the Dodger and ****** ***** had **** out to ****** their ********* **********, Mr. Fagin took the *********** of ******* Oliver a long ******* on the ****** *** of ***********; of which he ******* ************ he had been ******, to no ******** ******, in ******** ********* himself from the ******* of his ******* *******; and, ***** more, in ************ to ****** from them after so much ******* and ******* had been ******** in his ********. Mr. Fagin **** great ****** on the **** of his having ***** Oliver in, and ********* him, when, without his ****** ***, he might have ******** with ******; and he ******* the ****** and ********* ******* of a young *** ****, in his ************, he had ********* ***** ******** *************, but who, ******* ******** of his ********** and ******** a ****** to *********** with the ******, had ************* come to be ****** at the Old ****** one *******.  Mr. Fagin did not **** to ******* his ***** in the ***********, but ******** with ***** in his eyes that the *****-****** and *********** ********* of the young ****** in ********, had ******** it ********* that he should ****** the ****** of ******* ******** for the *****: which, if it were not ********* ****, was ************* ********* for the ****** of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few ****** *******.  Mr. Fagin ********* by ******* a ****** ************ ******* of the *********** of *******; and, with great ************ and ********** of ******, ********* his ******* ***** that he might never be ******* to ****** Oliver ***** to that ********** *********. 

Little Oliver's ***** *** ****, as he ******** to the ***'* words, and *********** ************ the **** ******* ******** in them.  That it was ******** even for ******* ****** to ******** the ******** with the ****** when they were in ********** *************, he **** *******; and that ******-**** ***** for the *********** of ************** ******* or ****-************* *******, had been ****** ******* and ******* out by the Jew on more ********* than one, he thought by no ***** ********, when he *********** the ******* ****** of the ************ ******* that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which ****** to **** ********* to some ******** ********** of the ****.  As he ******* ******* up, and *** the ***'* ********* look, he **** that his **** face and ********* ***** were ******* ********* *** ********** by that **** old gentleman. 

The Jew, ******* *********, ****** Oliver on the head, and said, that if he **** himself *****, and ******* himself to ********, he *** they would be very good ******* ***.  Then, ****** his ***, and ******** himself with an old ******* *****-****, he **** out, and ****** the ****-**** ****** him. 

And so Oliver ******** all that day, and for the ******* **** of many ********** ****, ****** ******, ******* ***** ******* and ********, and left ****** the long ***** to ******* with his own ********.  Which, never ******* to ****** to his **** *******, and the ******* they must long *** have ****** of him, were *** ******. 

After the ***** of a **** or so, the Jew left the ****-**** ********; and he was at ******* to ****** about the house. 

It was a very ***** place.  The ***** ******** had great **** ****** *******-****** and ***** *****, with ******** ***** and ******** to the *******; which, ******** they were ***** with ******* and ****, were ********** in ******* ****.  From all of these ****** Oliver ********* that a long time ***, before the old Jew was ****, it had ******** to better ******, and had ******* been ***** *** and ********:  ****** and ****** as it looked now. 

******* had ***** their **** in the ****** of the ***** and ********; and *********, when Oliver ****** ****** into a room, the **** would ******* ****** the *****, and *** back ********* to their *****.  With these **********, there was ******* ***** *** ***** of any ****** *****; and *****, when it **** ****, and he was ***** of ********* from room to room, he would ****** in the ****** of the ******* by the ******-****, to be as **** ****** ****** as he could; and would ****** there, ********* and ******** the *****, ***** the Jew or the **** 



In all the *****, the ********** ******** were **** ******:  the **** which **** them were ******* ***** into the ****; the only ***** which was ********, ******** its way through round ***** at the ***: which made the ***** more ******, and ****** them with ******* *******. There was a ****-****** ****** with ***** **** *******, which had no *******; and out of this, Oliver ***** ***** with a ********** face for ***** ********; but nothing was to be ******** from it but a ******** and ******* **** of *********, ********* ********, and *****-****. *********, ******, a ******* head might be ****, ******* over the *******-**** of a ******* house; but it was ******* ********* again; and as the ****** of Oliver's *********** was ****** down, and ****** with the **** and ***** of *****, it was as much as he could do to make out the ***** of the ********* ******* ******, without ****** any ******* to be **** or *****,--***** he had as much ****** of being, as if he had ***** ****** the **** of **. ****'* *********. 

One *********, the Dodger and ****** ***** being ******* out that *******, the *****-***** young gentleman took it into his head to ****** some ******* ********* the ********** of his ****** (to do him *******, this was by no ***** an ******** ******** with him); and, with this *** and ***, he *************** ********* Oliver to ****** him in his ******, ***********. 

Oliver was but too **** to make himself ******; too ***** to have some *****, ******* ***, to look upon; too ******** to ********** ***** about him when he could ******** do so; to ***** any ********* in the way of this ********.  So he at once ********* his *********; and, ******** on the *****, ***** the Dodger *** upon the ***** so that he could take his **** in his ****, he ******* himself to a ******* which Mr. ******* ********** as '********* his *******-*****.'  The ******, ******** into ***** *******, **********, ******** his *****. 

******* it was the ***** of ******* and ************ which a ******** ****** may be ******** to **** when he **** on a ***** in an **** ******** ******* a ****, ******** one *** ********** to and ***, and having his ***** ******* all the time, without even the **** ******* of having ***** them off, or the *********** ****** of ******* them on, to ******* his ***********; or ******* it was the ******** of the ******* that ******* the ******** of the Dodger, or the ******** of the **** that ********* his ********; he was ********* *********, for the *****, with a ***** of ******* and **********, ******* to his ******* ******. He looked down on Oliver, with a ********** ***********, for a ***** *****; and then, ******* his head, and ******* a ****** ****, said, **** in ***********, and **** to ****** *****: 

'What a **** it is he ***'* a ****!' 

'**!' said ****** ******* *****; 'he don't know ****'* good for him.' 

The Dodger ****** again, and ******* his ****: as did ******* *****. They **** ******, for some *******, in *******. 

'I ******* you don't even know what a **** is?' said the Dodger 



'I think I know that,' replied Oliver, looking up.  'It's a the--; ***'** one, are you not?' inquired Oliver, ******** himself. 

'I am,' replied the Dodger.  '*'* ***** to be ******** ****.'  Mr. ******* **** his *** a ********* ****, after ********** this *********, and looked at ****** *****, as if to ****** that he would **** ******* by his ****** ******** to the ********. 

'I am,' ******** the Dodger.  '**'* *******.  **'* Fagin. **'* Sikes. **'* Nancy.  **'* ***.  So we all are, down to the ***. And **'* the ******** one of the ***!' 

'And the ***** ***** to ********,' ***** ******* *****. 

'He ******'* so much as **** in a *******-***, for **** of ********** himself; no, not if you **** him up in one, and left him there without ******* for a *********,' said the Dodger. 

'Not a *** of it,' ******** *******. 

'**'* a *** ***.  Don't he look ****** at any ******* **** that ****** or ***** when **'* in *******!' ******* the Dodger. '***'* he ***** at all, when he ***** a ****** *******!  And don't he **** other **** as ***'* of his *****!  Oh, no!' 

'**'* an ***-***-*** *********,' said *******. 

This was ****** ******** as a ******* to the ******'* *********, but it was an *********** ****** in another *****, if ****** ***** had only ***** it; for there are a good many ****** and *********, ******** to be ***-***-*** **********, ******* ****, and Mr. Sikes' ***, there ***** ****** and ******** ****** of ***********. 

'Well, well,' said the Dodger, ********* to the ***** from which they had *******: with that *********** of his ********** which ********** all his ***********.  'This ****'* go ******** to do with young ***** 



'No more it has,' said *******.  'Why don't you *** ******** ***** Fagin, Oliver?' 

'And make your ******' out of hand?' ***** the Dodger, with a ****. 

'And so be **** to ****** on your ********, and do the ***-****: as I **** to, in the very **** ****-**** but **** that **** *****, and the *****-****** ******* in *******-****,' said ******* *****. 

'I don't like it,' ******** Oliver, *******; 'I **** they would let me go.  *--*--***** ****** go.' 

'And Fagin would ****** not!' ******** *******. 

Oliver **** this too well; but ******** it might be ********* to ******* his ******** more ******, he only ******, and **** on with his 



'Go!' ********* the Dodger.  'Why, *****'* your ******?' Don't you take any ***** out of ********?  Would you go and be ********* on your 



'Oh, **** that!' said ****** *****: ******* two or ***** **** ************* from his ******, and ******* them into a ********, 'that's too ****; that is.' 

'_I_ ******'* do it,' said the Dodger, with an *** of ******* *******. 

'You can ***** your *******, ******,' said Oliver with a **** *****; 'and let them be ******** for what you did.' 

'That,' ******** the Dodger, with a **** of his ****, 'That was all out of ************* for Fagin, '***** the ***** know that we **** ********, and he might have got into ******* if we ****'* made *** *****; that was the ****, ****'* it, *******?'

'Look here!' said the Dodger, ******* ***** a ******* of ********* and *********. '****'* a ***** life!  ****'* the **** where it ***** from? Here, ***** ****; *****'* ****** more where they were took from.  You ***'*, ***'* you?  Oh, you ******** ****!' 

'It's *******, ***'* it, Oliver?' inquired ******* *****. '**'** come to be ********, ***'* he?' 

'I don't know what that *****,' replied Oliver. 

'********* in this way, old ******,' said ******.  As he said it, ****** ***** ****** up an *** of his ***********; and, ******* it ***** in the ***, ******* his head on his ********, and ****** a ******* ***** through his *****; ******* **********, by a ****** ********** **************, that ********* and ******* were one and the same *****. 

'That's what it *****,' said *******.  'Look how he ******, ****!

'A boy!' ********* the Jew.  'Oh! then it's a *****, **?' 

'Never mind *** it is!' replied Sikes.  'I **** a boy, and he ****'* be a *** '**.  ****!' said Mr. Sikes, ************, 'if *'* only got that young boy of ***, the ********-*******'*!  He **** him ***** on *******, and let him out by the ***.  But the ****** **** ******; and then the ******** ********** ******* *****, and ***** the boy away from a ***** where he was ******* *****, ******* him to **** and *****, and in time ***** a '******** of him.

The Jew ****** his head ******* Nancy, who was ***** ****** at the ****; and *********, by a ****, that he would have her **** to ***** the room.

The Jew ****** much ***** by Oliver's not ********** any ******* ********* on the *******; but the ***** is, that, ******** Oliver **** very *******, he was too much ******** by the ******* ******* of *****'* *****, and his own ************, to make any ******* ********* **** then.

Oliver ****** his head upon his hand when the old man ***********, and ********, with a ********* *****, on the words he had **** *****.  The more he thought of the ***'* **********, the more he was at a **** to ****** its **** ******* and *******. 

He could think of no *** ****** to be ******** by ******* him to Sikes, which would not be ******* well ******** by his ********* with Fagin; and after ********** for a long time, ********* that he had been ******** to ******* some ******** ****** ******* for the ************, ***** another boy, better ****** for his ******* could be *******.

Oliver ****** the ****** ***** his head: and looked ******* the door. It was Nancy.

'Have it your own way,' ******** the girl, ********* to *****. 'For no good, then.' 

Oliver could see that he had some ***** over the ****'* better ********, and, for an *******, thought of ********* to her ********** for his ******** *****.  But, then, the thought ****** ****** his mind that it was ****** ****** *'*****; and that many ****** were ***** in the *******:  of **** ****** some might be ***** to **** ******** to his ****.

Mr. Bumble ******** his *** without another ****; ******** Mrs. ******'* little ****** as she took it; and ********** two ****-****** ***** upon his ***** *********, **** a ****** ****, and ******* his ***** a very little ****** ******* from the ****.

As Sikes ******* ***** this ***********, with the most ********* ******** that his ********* ****** was ******* of, he ****** the **** of the ******* boy ****** his ****** ****; and turned his head, for an *******, to look back at his ********. 

There was little to be made out, in the **** and ********; but the **** ******** of *** ******** through the ***, and the ******* of the ************ ****, ****** by the ***** of the ***** ****, ********* in every *********.

'I am ********* to ******** which is ********* to Mr. Giles,' said a ******* man; who was by no ***** of a **** ******, and who was very **** in the face, and very ******: as ********** *** ********** are.

Now, these **** ******* ***** from Mr. *****'* *****; and Mr. *****'* ***** had ****** from his *********** at having the ************** of ***** **** again, ******* upon himself ***** ***** of a **********. The ***** man ******* the ******* to a *****, most ***************.

'But it's *********,' said Mr. Giles, when he had *********, 'what a man will do, when his ***** is up.  I should have ********* ******--* know I ******--** **'* ****** one of them *******.' 

As the other two were ********* with a ******* ************; and as their *****, like his, had all **** down again; some *********** ****** upon the ***** of this ****** ****** in their ***********.

This ******** was **** ******* the two *** who had ********* the ********, and a ********** ****** who had been ******** in an ********, and who had been ******, ******** with his two ******* ****, to **** in the *******.

The ******* which had looked *** and ******** in the ********, **** more and more *******, and ********* ******** into their ******** ******.  The **** came down, ***** and ****, and ******** ******* ***** the ******** ******.  But, Oliver **** it not, as it **** ******* him; for he ***** *** *********, ******** and ***********, on his *** of ****. 

At ******, a *** *** of **** ***** the ********* that *********; and ******** it, the boy *****.

After a ***** ****** of the ****** in which he had been so long *******, Oliver:  ***** by a ******** ******** at his *****, which ****** to **** him that if he *** there, he must ****** ***:  got upon his ****, and ******* to ****. His head was *****, and he ********* to and *** like a ******* man.  But he **** up, ************, and, with his head ******** ********* on his ******, **** ********* ******, he **** not *******. 

And now, ***** of *********** and ******** ***** came ******** on his mind.

As he **** ****** to this house, a ******* come over him that he had **** it before.  He ********** nothing of its *******; but the ***** and ****** of the ******** ****** ******** to him.

Oliver **** such **** come over him when he ********** the place, that, for the *******, he ****** the ***** of his *****, and thought only of ******.  ******!  He could ******** *****:  and if he were in **** ********** of all the **** ****** of his ****** and ******** *****, ******* could he ***?  He ****** ******* the ******-****; it was ********, and ***** **** on its ******.  He ******** ****** the ****; ******* the *****; ******* ******* at the door; and, his ***** ******** ******* him, **** down ******* one of the ******* of the little *******. 

It ******** that about this time, Mr. Giles, ********, and the ******, were ********** **********, after the ******** and ******* of the night, with *** and ********, in the *******.

At this ***** of the ********* the **** turned ****, and asked the ********* to **** the door: who asked ********, who asked the ******, who ********* not to hear.

'What **** of a *****?' asked the ****. 

'A **** of a ******* *****,' replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.

With many ********** ********** that they would be ********* ********* in the ****** of the ********, the doctor **** the young ****'* *** through one of his; and ******** his ********** hand to Mrs. ******, *** them, with much ******** and ***********, ********. 

'Now,' said the doctor, in a *******, as he ****** turned the ****** of a *******-****, 'let us hear what you think of him.  He has not been ****** very ********, but he don't look at all ********* ***************.  ****, ******!  Let me first see that he is in ******** *****.' 

******** before them, he looked into the room.  ********* them to *******, he ****** the door when they had *******; and ****** **** back the ******** of the ***.  Upon it, in **** of the ******, *****-******* ******* they had ******** to ******, there *** a **** child:  **** with **** and **********, and **** into a **** *****.  His ******* ***, ***** and ********** up, was ******* upon his ******; his head ******** upon the other ***, which was **** ****** by his long ****, as it ******** over the ******. 

The ****** gentleman **** the ******* in his hand, and looked on, for a ****** or so, in *******.  ****** he was ******** the ******* ****, the ******* lady ****** ****** ****, and ******* ******* in a ***** by the *******, ******** Oliver's **** from his face.  As she ******* over him, her ***** **** upon his ********.

'What can this ****?' ********* the ***** lady.  'This **** child can never have been the ***** of *******!' 

'****,' said the *******, ********* the *******, '***** up her ***** in many *******; and who can say that a **** ******* ***** not ******** 



'But at so ***** an ***!' ***** Rose. 

'My dear young lady,' ******** the *******, ********** ******* his head; '*****, like *****, is not ******** to the old and ******** *****.  The ******** and ******* are too ***** its ****** *******.' 

'But, can ***--**! can you ****** ******* that this ******** boy has been the ********* ********* of the ***** ******** of *******?' said 



The ******* ***** his head, in a ****** which ********* that he ****** it was very ********; and ********* that they might ******* the *******, *** the way into an ********* *********. 

'But even if he has been ******,' ******* Rose, 'think how young he is; think that he may never have ***** a ******'* ****, or the ******* of a ****; that ***-***** and *****, or the **** of *****, may have ****** him to **** with *** who have ****** him to *****.  ****, dear ****, for *****'* ****, think of this, before you let them **** this **** child to a ******, which in any **** must be the ***** of all his ******* of *********.  Oh! as you **** me, and know that I have never **** the **** of ******* in your ******** and *********, but that I might have done so, and might have been ******* ******** and *********** with this **** child, have **** upon him before it is too 



'My dear ****,' said the ***** lady, as she ****** the ******* girl to her *****, 'do you think I would **** a **** of his head?' 

'Oh, no!' replied Rose, *******. 

'No, ******,' said the old lady; 'my **** are ******* to their *****: and may ***** be ***** to me as I **** it to ******! What can I do to **** him, sir?' 

'Let me think, **'**,' said the doctor; 'let me think.' 

Mr. ******** ****** his hands into his *******, and took ******* ***** up and down the room; ***** ********, and ********* himself on his ****, and ******** ***********.  After ******* ************ of '*'** got it now' and 'no, I *****'*,' and as many ******** of the ******* and ********, he at ****** made a **** ****, and ***** as *******: 

'I think if you **** me a **** and ********* ********** to ***** Giles, and that little boy, ********, I can ****** it.  Giles is a ******** ****** and an old *******, I know; but you can make it up to him in a ******** ****, and ****** him for being such a good **** *******.  You don't ****** to that?' 

'****** there is some other way of ********** the child,' replied Mrs. 



'There is no other,' said the doctor.  'No other, take my **** for it.' 

'Then my **** ******* you with **** *****,' said Rose, ******* through her *****; 'but **** don't be ****** upon the **** ******* than is ************* *********.' 

'You **** to think,' ******** the doctor, 'that ********* is ******** to be ****-******* **-***, ****** ********, **** Rose. I only ****, for the **** of the ****** **** *** *********, that you may be ***** in as ********** and ****-******* a **** by the first ******** young ****** who ******* to your **********; and I **** I were a young ******, that I might ***** ******, on the ****, of such a ********** *********** for ***** so, as the *******.' 

'You are as great a boy as **** ******** himself,' ******** Rose, 



'Well,' said the doctor, ******** ********, 'that is no very ********* ******.  But to ****** to this boy.  The great ***** of *** ********* is *** to come.  He will **** in an **** or so, I **** say; and ******** I have **** that *****-****** *********-****** ********** that he ****'* be ***** or ****** to, on ***** of his life, I think we may ******** with him without ******.  Now I make this ***********--**** I shall ******* him in your ********, and that, if, from what he ****, we *****, and I can **** to the ************ of your **** ******, that he is a **** and ******** *** one (which is more than ********), he shall be left to his ****, without any ******* ************ on my ****, at all ******.' 

'Oh no, ****!' ********* Rose. 

'Oh yes, ****!' said the doctor.  'Is is a *******?' 

'He ****** be ******** in ****,' said Rose; 'It is **********.' 

'Very good,' ******** the doctor; 'then so much the more ****** for ******** to my ***********.' 

******* the ****** was ******* into; and the ******* ********* *** down to ****, with some **********, ***** Oliver should *****. 

The ******** of the two ****** was ******** to ******* a ****** ***** than Mr. ******** had *** them to ******; for **** after **** ****** on, and ***** Oliver ********* *******.  It was *******, ******, before the ****-******* doctor ******* them the ************, that he was at ****** ************ ******** to be ****** to.  The boy was very ill, he said, and **** from the **** of *****; but his mind was so ******** with ******* to ******** *********, that he ****** it better to **** him the ***********, than to ****** upon his ********* ***** ***** **** *******: which he should ********* have done. 

The ********** was a long one.  Oliver **** them all his ****** *******, and was ***** ********* to ****, by **** and **** of ********. It was a ****** *****, to hear, in the ******** room, the ****** voice of the **** child ********** a ***** ********* of ***** and ********** which **** *** had ******* upon him.  Oh! if when we ******* and ***** *** ******-*********, we ******** but one thought on the **** ********* of ***** *****, which, like ***** and ***** ******, are ******, ****** it is ****, but not **** ******, to ******, to **** their *****-********* on *** *****; if we ***** but one *******, in ***********, the **** ********* of **** ***'* ******, which no ***** can ******, and no ***** **** out; where would be the ****** and *********, the *********, ******, *******, and *****, that **** ***'* life ****** with it! 

Oliver's ****** was ******** by ****** hands that night; and ********** and ****** ******* him as he *****.  He **** **** and *****, and could have **** without a ******. 

The ********* ********* was no ****** *********, and Oliver ******** to **** again, than the doctor, after ****** his eyes, and ********** them for being **** all at once, ****** himself ********** to **** upon Mr. Giles.  And ******* ****** about the ********, it ******** to him, that he could ******* ********* the *********** with better ****** in the *******; so into the ******* he ****. 

There were *********, in that ***** house of the ******** **********, the *****-********, Mr. ********, Mr. Giles, the ****** (who had ******** a ******* ********** to ****** himself for the ********* of the day, in ************* of his ********), and the *********.

'That's not the *****,' said the doctor, ************.  'Mr. Giles, are you a **********?'

'Then tell me this,' said the doctor, '**** of you, **** of you! Are you ***** to take upon ********** to *****, that that boy ******** is the boy that was *** through the little ****** **** night?  Out with it!  Come!  We are ******** for you!' 

The doctor, who was *********** ********** one of the ****-******** ********* on *****, made this ****** in such a ******** **** of *****, that Giles and ********, who were ************ ******* by *** and **********, ****** at **** other in a ***** of ************.

The ********* looked as **** as he could, and took up his ***** of ******: which had been ********* ********** in the *******-******. 

'It's a ****** ******** of ********, you will *******,' said the doctor. 

'That's what it is, sir,' replied the *********, ******** with great ********; for he had ******** his *** in a *****, and some of it had **** the ***** way. 

'****'* the house ****** into,' said the doctor, 'and a ****** of *** ***** one ******'* ******* of a boy, in the ***** of ********* *****, and in all the *********** of ***** and ********.  ****'* a boy ***** to that very same house, **** *******, and ******* he ******* to have his *** **** up, these *** *** ******* hands upon ***--** ***** which, they place his life in great ******--*** ***** he is the *****.

Oliver's ******* were ******* ****** *** few.

But, at ******, he *****, by **** *******, to *** better, and to be **** to say *********, in a few ******* words, how ****** he **** the ******** of the two ***** ******, and how ******** he ***** that when he **** ****** and well again, he could do ********* to **** his *********; only *********, which would let them see the **** and **** with which his ****** was ****; *********, ******* ******, which would ***** to them that their ****** ******** had not been **** away; but that the **** boy **** their ******* had ******* from ******, or *****, was ***** to ***** them with his ***** ***** and ****. 

'**** ******!' said Rose, when Oliver had been one day ****** ************ to ***** the words of ************ that rose to his **** ****; 'you shall have many ************* of ******* us, if you will. We are ***** into the *******, and my **** ******* that you shall ********* us.  The ***** place, the **** ***, and all the ******** and ******** of ******, will ******* you in a few ****.  We will ****** you in a ******* ****, when you can **** the *******.' 

'The *******!' cried Oliver.  'Oh! dear lady, if I could but **** for you; if I could only **** you ******** by ******** your *******, or ******** your *****, or ******* up and down the ***** day long, to make you *****; what would I **** to do it!' 

'You shall **** nothing at all,' said **** ******, *******; 'for, as I **** you before, we shall ****** you in a ******* ****; and if you only take **** the ******* to ****** us, that you ******* now, you will make me very ***** ******.' 

'*****, **'**!' cried Oliver; 'how **** of you to say so!' 

'You will make me ******* than I can tell you,' replied the young lady. 'To think that my dear good **** should have been the ***** of ******** any one from such *** ****** as you have ********* to us, would be an *********** ******** to me; but to know that the ****** of her ******** and ********** was ********* ******** and ********, in ***********, would ******* me, more than you can well *******.  Do you ********** me?' she inquired, ******** Oliver's ********** face. 

'Oh yes, **'**, yes!' replied Oliver *******; 'but I was ******** that I am ********** now.' 

'To ****?' inquired the young lady. 

'To the **** gentleman, and the dear old *****, who took so much **** of me before,' ******** Oliver.  'If they **** how ***** I am, they would be *******, I am ****.' 

'I am **** they would,' ******** Oliver's ************; 'and Mr. ******** has ******* been **** ****** to ******* that when you are well ****** to **** the *******, he will ***** you to see them.' 

'Has he, **'**?' cried Oliver, his face *********** with ********.  'I don't know what I shall do for *** when I see their **** ***** once 



In a ***** time Oliver was ************ ********* to ******* the ******* of this **********.  One ******* he and Mr. ******** *** out, ***********, in a little ******** which ******** to Mrs. ******.  When they came to ******** ******, Oliver turned very ****, and ******* a **** ***********.

'Yes; well, what of it?  **** ********.  **** up here,' cried the doctor.  'What of the house, my man; **?' 

'The *******--*** house they took me to!' ********* Oliver. 

'The ***** it is!' cried the doctor.  '*****, there! let me out!' 

But, before the ******** could ******** from his ***, he had ******* out of the *****, by some ***** or other; and, ******* down to the ******** ********, ***** ******* at the door like a ******. 

'******?' said a little **** ****-****** man:  ******* the door so ********, that the doctor, from the very ******* of his **** ****, ****** **** ******* into the *******. '****'* the ****** here?' 

'******!' ********* the other, ********* him, without a ******'* **********.  'A good ****.  ******* is the ******.' 

'*****'** be ****** the ******, too,' replied the ****-****** man, ******, 'if you don't take your hands off.  Do you hear me?' 

'I hear you,' said the doctor, ****** his ******* a ****** *****. 

'*****'*--******** the ******, ****'* his ******** ****--*****; that's it.  *****'* Sikes, you *****?' 

The ****-****** man ******, as if in ****** of ********* and ***********; then, ******** himself, ***********, from the ******'* *****, ******* ***** a ****** of ****** *****, and ******* into the house.  Before he could **** the door, *******, the doctor had ****** into the *******, without a **** of ******. 

He looked ********* round; not an ******* of *********; not a ******* of ********, ******* or *********; not even the ******** of the *********; ******** Oliver's ***********! 

'Now!' said the ****-****** man, who had ******* him ******, 'what do you **** by ****** into my house, in this ******* way? Do you **** to *** me, or to ****** me?  Which is it?' 

'Did you **** know a man come out to do ******, in a ******* and ****, you ********** old *******?' said the ********* doctor. 

'What do you ****, then?' ******** the *********.  'Will you take ******** off, before I do you a ********?  ***** you!' 

'As **** as I think ******,' said Mr. ********, looking into the other *******; which, like the first, **** no *********** ******** to Oliver's ******* of it.  'I shall **** you out, some day, my ******.' 

'Will you?' ******* the ***-******** *******.  'If you **** **** me, *'* here.  I *****'* ***** here *** and all *****, for ****-***-****** *****, to be ****** by you.  You shall *** for this; you shall *** for this.'  And so ******, the ***-****** little ***** *** up a ****, and ****** upon the ******, as if **** with ****. 

'****** ******, this,' ******** the doctor to himself; 'the boy must have made a *******.  Here!  *** that in your ******, and **** ******** up again.'  With these words he ***** the ********* a ***** of *****, and ******** to the ********. 

The man ******** to the ******* door, ******** the ******* ************ and ****** all the way; but as Mr. ******** turned to ***** to the ******, he looked into the ********, and **** Oliver for an ******* with a ****** so ***** and ****** and at the same time so ******* and **********, that, ****** or ********, he could not ****** it for ****** **********.  He ********* to ***** the most ******* ************, ***** the ****** had ******* his ****; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some ******** ******: ******* his **** upon the ******, and ******* his ****, in ********** of **** or ********* ****. 

'I am an ***!' said the doctor, after a long *******.  'Did you know that before, Oliver?' 

'No, sir.' 

'Then don't ****** it another time.' 

'An ***,' said the doctor again, after a ******* ******* of some *******.  'Even if it had been the ***** place, and the ***** ******* had been there, what could I have done, ******-******? And if I had had **********, I see no good that I should have done, ****** ******* to my own ********, and an *********** ********* of the ****** in which I have ****** up this ********. That would have ****** me *****, ******. I am ****** ********* ****** in some ****** or other, by ****** on *******.  It might have done me good.' 

Now, the **** was that the ********* doctor had never ***** upon ******** but ******* all through his life, and it was no *** ********** to the ****** of the ******** which ******** him, that so *** from being ******** in any ******** ******** or ***********, he had the ******* ******* and ****** of all who **** him.

He **** came round again, *******; and ******* that Oliver's ******* to his *********, were ***** as *************** and **********, and ***** ********* with as much ******** ********* and *****, as they had **** been, he made up his mind to ****** **** ******** to them, from that time *****. 

As Oliver **** the **** of the ****** in which Mr. Brownlow *******, they were ******* to ***** ******** *******.  When the ***** turned into it, his ***** **** so *********, that he could ******** **** his 



'Now, my boy, which house is it?' inquired Mr. ********. 

'That!  That!' replied Oliver, ******** ******* out of the ******. 'The ***** house.  Oh! make *****!  **** make *****! I **** as if I should ***: it ***** me ******* so.' 

'Come, come!' said the good doctor, ******* him on the ********. 'You will see them ********, and they will be ********* to **** you **** and 



'Oh!  I **** so!' cried Oliver.  'They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.' 

The ***** ****** on.  It *******.  No; that was the ***** house; the **** door.  It **** on a few *****, and ******* again. Oliver looked up at the *******, with ***** of ***** *********** ******** down his face.

'***** at the **** door,' cried Mr. ********, ****** Oliver's *** in his.  'What has ****** of Mr. Brownlow, who **** to **** in the ********* house, do you know?' 

The ******* did not know; but would go and *******.  She ********* ********, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had **** off his *****, and **** to the **** ******, *** ***** before.  Oliver ******* his hands, and **** ****** ********. 

'Has his *********** **** too?' inquired Mr. ********, after a ******'* 



'Yes, sir'; replied the *******.  'The old gentleman, the ***********, and a gentleman who was a ****** of Mr. ********'*, all **** ********.' 

'Then **** ******* **** again,' said Mr. ******** to the ******; 'and don't **** to **** the ******, **** you *** out of this ********** 



'The ****-***** ******, sir?' said Oliver.  'I know the way there.  See him, ****, sir!  Do see him!' 

'My **** boy, this is ************** ****** for one day,' said the doctor.  '***** ****** for **** of us.

Then, he would **** with Mrs. ****** and Rose, and hear them **** of *****; or ******* *** **** them, in some ***** place, and ****** ****** the young lady ****: which he could have done, ***** it **** too **** to see the *******. Then, he had his own ****** for the **** day to *******; and at this, he would **** ****, in a little room which looked into the ******, **** ******* came ****** on, when the ****** would **** out again, and he with them: ********* with such ******** to all they said:  and so ***** if they ****** a ****** that he could ***** to *****, or had ********* ******** he could *** to *****: that he could never be ***** ****** about it. When it ****** ***** ****, and they ******** ****, the young lady would *** down to the *****, and **** some ******** ***, or ****, in a *** and ****** voice, some old **** which it ******* her **** to hear. There would be no ******* ******* at such ***** as these; and Oliver would *** by one of the *******, ********* to the ***** *****, in a ******* *******. 

And when ****** came, how *********** the day was *****, from any way in which he had **** ***** it ***! and how ******* too; like all the other **** in that most ***** time!  There was the little ******, in the *******, with the ***** ****** ********** at the *******:  the ***** ******* without:  and the *****-******** *** ******** in at the *** *****, and ******* the ****** ******** with its *********. The **** ****** were so **** and *****, and ***** so ********** in ******, that it ****** a ********, not a ******* ****, their ********** there ********; and ****** the ******* might be ****, it was ****, and ******* more ******* (to Oliver's **** at *****) than any he had **** ***** in ****** before.  Then, there were the ***** as *****, and many ***** at the ***** ****** of the ********* ***; and at night, Oliver **** a ******* or two from the *****, which he had been ******** all the ****, and in the *********** of which **** he **** more ***** and *******, than if he had been the ********* himself. 

In the *******, Oliver would be *-**** by *** *'*****, ******* the ******, and ********** the ******, *** and ****, for ******** of **** *******, with which he would ****** *****, ****; and which it took great **** and ************* to *******, to the **** *********, for the ************* of the *********-*****. There was ***** *********, too, for **** ******'* *****, with which Oliver, who had been ******** the ******* ***** the **** ******* of the ******* *****, would ******** the *****, in the most ******** *****. When the ***** were made all ****** and ***** for the day, there was ******* some little ********** of ******* to ******* in the *******; or, ******* that, there was **** *******-*******, *********, on the *****; or, ******* that, there was ****** ********* to do in the ******, or about the ******, to which Oliver (who had ******* this ******* ****, ***** the same ******, who was a ******** by *****,) ******* himself with ****** ****-****, ***** **** Rose made her **********:  when there were a ******** ************* to be ******** on all he had done. 

So ***** ****** ****** away; ***** ****** which, in the life of the most ******* and ******** of *******, might have been ********* *********, and which, in Oliver's were **** ********. With the ****** and most ******* ********** on one ****; and the ******, *******, ****-**** ********* on the other; it is no ****** that, by the *** of that ***** time, Oliver ***** had ****** ********** ************ with the old lady and her *****, and that the ******* ********** of his young and ********* *****, was ****** by their ***** in, and ********** to, himself.

******* THE ********* OF OLIVER AND HIS *******, *********** A ****** 



****** **** ******* by, and ****** came.  If the ******* had been ********* at first it was now in the **** **** and ********** of its ********.  The great *****, which had looked ******** and **** in the ******* ******, had now ***** into ****** life and ******; and ********** ***** their ***** **** over the ******* ******, ********* **** and ***** ***** into ****** *****, where was a **** and ******** ***** from which to look upon the **** ********, ******* in ********, which *** ********* ******.  The ***** had ****** her ****** of ********* *****; and **** her ******* ******** ******.  It was the ***** and ****** of the ****; all ****** were **** and ***********. 

*****, the same ***** life **** on at the little *******, and the same ******** ******** ********* ***** its *******.  Oliver had long ***** ***** ***** and *******; but ****** or ******** made no ********** in his **** ******** of a great many ******.  He was ***** the same ******, ********, ************ ******** that he had been when **** and ********* had ****** his ********, and when he was ********* for every ****** *********, and ******* on ***** who ****** him. 

One ********* night, when they had ***** a ****** **** than was ********* with them:  for the day had been ********* ****, and there was a ********* ****, and a ***** **** had ****** up, which was ********* **********.  Rose had been in **** *******, too, and they had ****** on, in ***** ************, ***** they had *** ******** their ******** ******.  Mrs. ****** being ********, they ******** more ****** ****.  The young lady ****** ******** off her ****** ******, *** down to the ***** as *****.  After ******* ************ over the **** for a few *******, she **** into a *** and very ****** ***; and as she ****** it, they ***** a ***** as if she were *******. 

'Rose, my dear!' said the ***** lady. 

Rose made no *****, but ****** a little *******, as ****** the words had ****** her from some ******* ********. 

'Rose, my ****!' cried Mrs. ******, ****** *******, and ******* over her.  'What is this?  In *****!  My dear child, what ********** you?' 

'Nothing, ****; nothing,' replied the young lady.  'I don't know what it is; I ***'* ******** it; but I ****--' 

'Not ill, my ****?' ********** Mrs. ******. 

'No, no!  Oh, not ill!' replied Rose: ********** as ****** some ****** ********* were ******* over her, ***** she *****; 'I shall be better *********.  ***** the ******, ****!' 

Oliver ******** to ****** with her *******.  The young lady, ****** an ****** to ******* her ************, ****** to **** some ******** ****; but her ******* ******* ********* over the ****. ******** her face with her hands, she **** upon a ****, and **** **** to the ***** which she was now ****** to *******. 

'My child!' said the ******* lady, ******* her **** about her, 'I never *** you so before.' 

'I would not ***** you if I could ***** it,' ******** Rose; 'but ****** I have ***** very ****, and ****** **** this. I **** I _am_ ill, ****.' 

She was, ******; for, when ******* were *******, they *** that in the very ***** time which had ******* ***** their ****** ****, the *** of her *********** had ******* to a ****** *********. Its ********** had **** nothing of its ******; but it was *******; and there was an ******* ******* look about the ****** face, which it had never **** before.  Another ******, and it was ******** with a ******* *****:  and a ***** ******** came over the **** **** ***.  Again this ***********, like the ****** ****** by a ******* *****; and she was once more ****** 



Oliver, who ******* the old lady *********, ******** that she was ******* by these ***********; and so in *****, was he; but ****** that she ******** to make ***** of them, he *********** to do the same, and they so *** *********, that when Rose was ********* by her **** to ****** for the night, she was in better *******; and ******** even in better ******:  ******** them that she **** ******* she should **** in the *******, ***** well. 

'I ****,' said Oliver, when Mrs. ****** ********, 'that nothing is the ******?  She don't look well **-*****, but--' 

The old lady ******** to him not to *****; and ******* ******* down in a **** ****** of the room, ******** ****** for some time. At ******, she said, in a ********* voice: 

'I **** not, Oliver.  I have been very ***** with her for some *****: too *****, *******.  It may be time that I should **** with some **********; but I **** it is not this.' 

'What?' inquired Oliver. 

'The ***** ****,' said the old lady, 'of ****** the dear girl who has so long been my ******* and *********.' 

'Oh!  *** ******!' ********* Oliver, *******. 

'**** to that, my child!' said the old lady, ******** her hands. 

'****** there is no ****** of ******** so ********?' said Oliver. 'Two ***** ***, she was ***** well.' 

'She is very ill now,' ******** Mrs. *******; 'and will be *****, I am ****.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her!' 

She **** way to such great *****, that Oliver, *********** his own *******, ******** to *********** with her; and to ***, *********, that, for the **** of the dear young lady *******, she would be more ****. 

'And ********, **'**,' said Oliver, as the ***** ****** ********** into his eyes, ******* of his ******* to the ********. 'Oh! ******** how young and good she is, and what ******** and ******* she ***** to all about her.  I am ****--*******--***** *******--****, for your ****, who are so good ********; and for her own; and for the **** of all she ***** so *****; she will not ***.  ****** will never let her *** so 



'****!' said Mrs. ******, ****** her hand on Oliver's head. 'You think like a child, **** boy.  But you ***** me my ****, ***************.  I had ********* it for a ******, Oliver, but I **** I may be ********, for I am old, and have **** ****** of ******* and ***** to know the ***** of ********** from the ******* of *** ****.  I have **** ******, too, to know that it is not ****** the ******** and **** who are ****** to ***** that **** them; but this should **** us ******* in *** ******; for ****** is ****; and such ****** ***** us, ************, that there is a ******** ***** than this; and that the ******* to it is ******. ***'* will be done!  I **** her; and He ***** how well!' 

Oliver was ********* to see that as Mrs. ****** said these words, she ******* her ************ as ****** by one ******; and ******* ******* up as she *****, ****** ******** and ****.  He was ***** more ********** to **** that this ******** ******; and that, ***** all the **** and ******** which ******, Mrs. ****** was **** ***** and *********: ********** all the ****** which had ******** upon her, ********, and, to all ******** ***********, even **********.  But he was young, and did not know what ****** ***** are ******* of, ***** ****** *************.  How should he, when their ********** so ****** know **********? 

An ******* night ******.  When ******* came, Mrs. ******'* *********** were but too well ********.  Rose was in the first ***** of a **** and ********* *****. 

'We must be ******, Oliver, and not **** way to ******* *****,' said Mrs. ******, ****** her ****** on her ***, as she looked ******** into his face; 'this ****** must be ****, with all ******** **********, to Mr. ********.  It must be ******* to the ******-****: which is not more than **** ***** off, by the ******** ****** the *****:  and ****** **********, by an ******* on *********, ******** to ********. The ****** at the *** will ********* to do this: and I can ***** to you to see it done, I know.' 

Oliver could make no *****, but looked his ******* to be **** at once. 

'Here is another ******,' said Mrs. ******, ******* to *******; 'but ******* to **** it now, or **** ***** I see how Rose **** on, I ******** know.  I would not ******* it, ****** I ****** the *****.' 

'Is it for ********, too, **'**?' inquired Oliver; ********* to ******* his **********, and ******* out his ********* hand for the ******. 

'No,' replied the old lady, ****** it to him ************. Oliver ******* at it, and *** that it was ******** to ***** ******, *******, at some great ****'* house in the *******; where, he could not make out. 

'Shall it go, **'**?' asked Oliver, looking up, ***********. 

'I think not,' replied Mrs. ******, ****** it back.  'I will **** ***** 



With these words, she **** Oliver her *****, and he ******* off, without more *****, at the ******** ***** he could ******. 

******* he *** ****** the ******, and down the little ***** which ********* ******* them: now ****** ****** by the **** **** on ****** ****, and now ******** on an **** *****, where the ****** and ********* were **** at their ****:  *** did he **** once, **** now and then, for a few *******, to ******* ******, ***** he came, in a great ****, and ******* with ****, on the little ******-***** of the ******-****. 

Here he ******, and looked about for the ***.  There were a ***** ****, and a *** *******, and a ****** ****-****; and in one ****** there was a ***** house, with all the **** about it ******* *****:  before which was the **** of 'The ******.'  To this he ********, as **** as it ****** his ***. 

He ***** to a ******* who was ****** ***** the *******; and who, after ******* what he ******, ******** him to the ******; who after ******* all he had to say again, ******** him to the ********; who was a **** gentleman in a **** *********, a ***** ***, **** ********, and ***** with **** to *****, ******* ******* a **** by the ******-****, ******* his ***** with a ****** *********. 

This gentleman ****** with much ************ into the *** to make out the ****:  which took a long time ****** out:  and after it was *****, and ****, a ***** had to be *******, and a man to be *******, which took up *** good ******* more.  ********* Oliver was in such a ********* ***** of ********** and *******, that he **** as if he could have ****** upon the ***** himself, and ******** away, **** ****, to the **** *****.  At ******, all was *****; and the little ****** having been ****** up, with many *********** and ********** for its ****** ********, the man *** ***** to his *****, and ******** over the ****** ****** of the ******-*****, was out of the ****, and ********* ***** the ********-****, in a ****** of *******. 

As it was ********* to **** ******* that ********** was **** for, and that no time had been ****, Oliver ******* up the ***-****, with a ******** ******* *****.  He was ******* out of the ******* when he ********** ******** ******* a **** man ******* in a *****, who was at that ****** ****** out of the *** door. 

'***!' cried the man, ****** his eyes on Oliver, and ******** *********.  'What the *****'* this?' 

'I *** your ******, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great ***** to *** ****, and ****'* see you were ******.' 

'*****!' ******** the man to himself, ******* at the boy with his ***** **** eyes.  'Who would have thought it! ***** him to *****! **'* ***** up from a ***** ******, to come in my way!' 

'I am *****,' ********* Oliver, ******** by the ******* ***'* **** look.  'I **** I have not **** you!' 

'*** you!' ******** the man, in a ******** *******; ******* his ******** *****; 'if I had only had the ******* to say the ****, I might have been **** of you in a night.  ****** on your head, and ***** ***** on your *****, you ***!  What are you ***** here?' 

The man ***** his ****, as he ******* these words ************. He ******** ******* Oliver, as if with the ********* of ****** a **** at him, but **** ********* on the ******:  ******** and *******, in a ***. 

Oliver *****, for a ******, at the ********* of the ****** (for such he ******** him to be); and then ****** into the house for ****.  Having **** him ****** ******* into the *****, he turned his face *********, ******* as **** as he could, to make up for **** time:  and ********* with a great **** of ************ and some ****, the ************* ********* of the ****** from **** he had **** ******. 

The ************ did not ***** in his ************ long, *******: for when he ******* the *******, there was ****** to ****** his mind, and to ***** all ************** of **** ********** from his ******. 

Rose ****** had ******* ***** *****; before ***-***** she was *********.  A ******* ************, who ******* on the ****, was in ******** ********** upon her; and after first ****** the *******, he had ***** Mrs. ****** *****, and ********** her ******** to be one of a most ******** ******. 'In ****,' he said, 'it would be little ***** of a *******, if she *********.' 

How ***** did Oliver ***** from his *** that night, and ******** out, with ********* ********, to the *********, ****** for the ********* ***** from the **** *******!  How ***** did a ******* ***** his *****, and **** ***** of ****** ***** upon his ****, when a ****** ********* of **** ****** him to **** that ********* too ******** to think of, had even then ********!  And what had been the ******** of all the ******* he had **** ********, ******** with ***** he ****** *****, now, in the ***** and ******* of his ************ for the life and ****** of the ****** ********, who was ********* on the **** *****'* *****! 

Oh! the ********, the *******, ***** ********, of ******** **** by ***** the life of one we ****** ****, is ********* in the *******!  Oh! the ******* ******** that ***** upon the mind, and make the ***** **** *********, and the ****** come *****, by the ***** of the ****** they ******* up before it; the ********* ******* _to be ***** *********_ to ******* the ****, or ****** the ******, which we have no ***** to *********; the ******* of **** and ******, which the *** *********** of *** ************ ********; what ******** can ***** these; what *********** or ********** can, in the **** **** and ***** of the time, ***** them! 

******* came; and the little ******* was ****** and *****. ****** ***** in ********; ******* ***** ******** at the ****, from time to time; ***** and ******** **** away in *****. All the ******** day, and for ***** after it had ***** ****, Oliver ***** ****** up and down the ******, ******* his eyes every ******* to the **** *******, and ********** to see the ******** ******, looking as if ***** *** ********* ******.  **** that night, Mr. ******** *******.  'It is ****,' said the good doctor, ******* away as he *****; 'so young; so much *******; but there is very little ****.' 

Another *******.  The *** ***** ********; as ******** as if it looked upon no ****** or ****; and, with every **** and ****** in **** ***** about her; with life, and ******, and ****** and ****** of ***, *********** her on every ****: the **** young ******** ***, ******* ****.  Oliver ***** away to the old **********, and ******* down on one of the ***** ******, **** and ****** for her, in *******. 

There was such ***** and ****** in the *****; so much of ********** and ***** in the ***** *********; such ********** ***** in the ***** of the ****** *****; such ******* in the ***** ****** of the ****, ********* ********; so much of life and ********** in all; that, when the boy ****** his ****** eyes, and looked about, the thought ************* ******** to him, that this was not a time for *****; that Rose could ****** never *** when ******* ****** were all so **** and ***; that ****** were for **** and ********* ******:  not for ******** and *********. He ****** thought that ******* were for the old and ********; and that they never ******* the young and ******** **** in their ******* *****. 

A ***** from the ****** **** ***** ******* on these ******** ********. Another!  Again!  It was ******* for the ******* *******.  A ***** of ****** ******** ******* the ****: ******* ***** *******; for the ****** was young.  They ***** ********* by a *****; and there was a ******--* ****** ****--***** the ******* *****.  But the *** ***** ********, and the ***** **** on. 

Oliver turned ********, ******** on the many ********** he had ******** from the young lady, and ******* that the time could come again, that he might never ***** ******* her how ******** and ******** he was.  He had no ***** for ****-******** on the ***** of *******, or **** of thought, for he had been ******* to her *******; and *** a ******* little ********* rose up before him, on which he ******* he might have been more *******, and more *******, and ****** he had been.  We **** be ******* how we **** with ***** about us, when every ***** ******* to some ***** ****** of *********, ******** of so much *******, and so little ****--** so many ****** *********, and so many more which might have been ********!  There is no ******* so **** as that which is **********; if we would be ****** its ********, let us ******** this, in time. 

When he ******* **** Mrs. ****** was ******* in the little *******. Oliver's ***** **** at ***** of her; for she had never left the ******* of her *****; and he ******** to think what ****** could have ****** her away.  He ****** that she had ****** into a **** *****, from which she would *****, ****** to ******** and life, or to *** them ********, and ***. 

They ***, *********, and ****** to *****, for *****.  The ******** **** was *******, with ***** which ****** that their ******** were *********, they ******* the *** as he **** ***** and *****, and, at ******, **** over *** and ***** ***** ********* **** which ****** his *********.  Their ***** **** ****** the ***** of an *********** ********.  They **** ************* ****** to the door, as Mr. ******** 



'What of Rose?' cried the old lady.  'Tell me at once!  I can **** it; ******** but ********!  Oh, tell me! in the **** of ******!' 

'You must ******* ********,' said the doctor ********** her. 'Be ****, my dear **'**, ****.' 

'Let me go, in ***'* ****!  My dear child!  She is ****! She is *****!' 

'No!' cried the doctor, ************.  'As He is good and ********, she will **** to ***** us all, for ***** to come.' 

The lady **** upon her *****, and ***** to **** her hands ********; but the ****** which had ********* her so long, **** up to ****** with her first ************; and she **** into the ******** **** which were ******** to ******* her.

******** SOME ************ *********** ******** TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ******* UPON THE *****; AND A *** ********* WHICH ******** TO 



It was ****** too much ********* to ****.  Oliver **** ******* and ********* by the ********** ************; he could not ****, or *****, or ****.  He had ******** the ***** of ************* ******** that had ******, *****, after a long ****** in the ***** ******* ***, a ***** of ***** came to his ******, and he ****** to ******, all at once, to a **** ***** of the ****** ****** that had ********, and the ****** ************* **** of ******* which had been ***** from his ******. 

The night was **** ******* in, when he ******** ********:  ***** with ******* which he had ******, with ******** ****, for the ********* of the **** *******.

Looking round, he *** that it was a ****-******, ****** at great *****; and as the ****** were *********, and the **** was ******, he ***** ******* ******* a **** ***** it should have ****** him. 

As it ****** on, Oliver ****** a ******* of a man in a ***** ********, ***** face ****** ******** to him, ******** his **** was so ***** that he could not ******** the ******.  In another ****** or two, the ******** was ****** out of the ******-******, and a ********** voice ******** to the ****** to ****:  which he did, as **** as he could **** up his ******.  Then, the ******** once again ********: and the same voice ****** Oliver by his ****. 

'Here!' cried the voice.  'Oliver, ****'* the ****?  **** Rose! ****** 



'Is is you, Giles?' cried Oliver, ******* up to the ******-****. 

Giles ****** out his ******** again, *********** to ****** some *****, when he was ******** ****** back by a young gentleman who ******** the other ****** of the ******, and who ******* ******** what was the ****. 

'In a ****!' cried the gentleman, 'Better or *****?' 

'******--**** better!' replied Oliver, *******. 

'***** ******!' ********* the gentleman.  'You are ****?' 

'*****, sir,' replied Oliver.  'The ****** took place only a few ***** ***; and Mr. ******** ****, that all ****** is at an ***.' 

The gentleman said not another ****, but, ******* the ******-****, ****** out, and ****** Oliver ********* by the ***, *** him *****. 

'You are ***** *******?  There is no *********** of any ******* on your ****, my boy, is there?' ******** the gentleman in a ********* voice. 'Do not ******* me, by ********* ***** that are not to be *********.' 

'I would not for the *****, sir,' replied Oliver.  '****** you may ******* me.  Mr. ********'* words were, that she would **** to ***** us all for many ***** to come.  I ***** him say so.' 

The ***** ***** in Oliver's eyes as he ******** the ***** which was the ********* of so much *********; and the gentleman turned his face away, and ******** ******, for some *******.  Oliver thought he ***** him ***, more than once; but he ****** to ********* him by any ***** ******--*** he could well ***** what his ******** ****--*** so ***** *****, ******** to be ******** with his *******. 

All this time, Mr. Giles, with the ***** ******** on, had been ******* on the ***** of the ******, ********** an ***** on **** ****, and ****** his eyes with a **** ****** ******-************ ****** with ***** *****.  That the ****** ****** had not been ******** *******, was ********** ************ by the very *** eyes with which he ******** the young gentleman, when he turned round and ********* him. 

'I think you had better go on to my ******'* in the ******, Giles,' said he.  'I would ****** **** ****** on, so as to **** a little time before I see her.  You can say I am ******.' 

'I *** your ******, Mr. *****,' said Giles:  ****** a ***** ****** to his ******* *********** with the ************; 'but if you would ***** the ******* to say that, I should be very much ******* to you.  It ******'* be ****** for the ***** to see me in this *****, sir; I should never have any more ********* with them if they did.' 

'Well,' ******** ***** ******, *******, 'you can do as you like. Let him go on with the *******, if you **** it, and do you ****** with us. Only first ******** that ******** for some more *********** ********, or we shall be ***** for ******.' 

Mr. Giles, ******** of his ********** *******, ******** off and ******** his ********; and *********** a ***, of ***** and ***** *****, which he took out of the ******.  This done, the ******* ***** off; Giles, Mr. ******, and Oliver, ******** at their *******. 

As they ****** *****, Oliver ******* from time to time with much ******** and ********* at the *** *****.  He ****** about ****-***-****** ***** of ***, and was of the ****** ******; his *********** was ***** and ********; and his ******** **** and *************.  *************** the ********** ******* ***** and ***, he **** so ****** a ******** to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great ********** in ********* their ************, if he had not ******* ****** of her as his ******.

'But why,' said the young man, 'why *** the ****** of that ********* which so ****** ********?  If Rose ***--* ****** ***** that **** ***--** this ******* had ********** ***********, how could you **** have ******** ********!  How could I **** have know ********* again!' 

'If that _had_ been the ****, *****,' said Mrs. ******, 'I **** your ********* would have been *********** ********, and that your ******* here, a day ****** or a day *****, would have been of very, very little 



'And who can ****** if it be so, ******?' ******** the young man; 'or why should I say, _**_?--** **--** **--*** know it, ******--*** must know it!' 

'I know that she ******** the **** and ****** **** the ***** of man can *****,' said Mrs. ******; 'I know that the ******** and ********* of her ****** ******* no ******** ******, but one that shall be **** and *******.  If I did not **** this, and know, *******, that a ******* ********* in one she ***** would ***** her *****, I should not **** my **** so ********* of ***********, or have to ********* so many ********* in my own *****, when I take what ***** to me to be the ****** **** of ****.' 

'This is ******, ******,' said *****.  'Do you ***** ******* that I am a boy ******** of my own mind, and ********* the ******** of my own 



'I think, my dear ***,' ******** Mrs. ******, ****** her hand upon his ********, 'that ***** has many ******** ******** which do not ****; and that ***** them are some, which, being *********, ****** only the more ********.  ***** all, I think' said the lady, ****** her eyes on her ***'* face, 'that if an ************, ******, and ********* man ***** a **** on ***** **** there is a *****, which, ****** it ********* in no ***** of ****, may be ******* by **** and ****** ****** upon her, and upon his ******** ****: and, in ***** ********** to his ******* in the *****, be **** in his *****, and made the ******* of ****** ******* him:  he may, no ****** how ******** and good his ******, one day ****** of the ********** he ****** in ***** life.

'You think so now, *****,' replied his ******. 

'And **** will!' said the young man.  'The ****** ***** I have ********, ****** the **** two ****, ****** from me the ****** to you of a ******* which, as you well know, is not one of *********, *** one I have ******* ******.

Mr. Bumble turned, and *********** the face of his *********** *******, who, *********** ************* the few words she had ********* of his *********, had ******** the ********* ****** at a *******. 

'Mrs. Bumble, **'**!' said Mr. Bumble, with a *********** *********. 

'Well!' cried the lady. 

'Have the ******** to look at me,' said Mr. Bumble, ****** his eyes upon her.  (If she ****** such a *** as that,' said Mr. Bumble to himself, 'she can ***** ********.  It is a *** I never **** to **** with *******.  If it ***** with her, my ***** is ****.')

'Are you ***** to *** ******* there, all day?' inquired Mrs. Bumble. 

'I am ***** to *** here, as long as I think ******, **'**,' ******** Mr. Bumble; 'and ******** I was _not_ *******, I shall *****, ****, ******, *****, or ***, as the ****** ******* me; such being my 



'_Your_ ***********!' ******* Mrs. Bumble, with ********* ********. 

'I said the ****, **'**,' said Mr. Bumble.  'The *********** of a man is to *******.' 

'And ****'* the *********** of a woman, in the **** of ********?' cried the ****** of Mr. ****** ********. 

'To ****, **'**,' ********* Mr. Bumble.  'Your **** *********** ******* should have ****** it you; and then, *******, he might have been ***** now.  I **** he was, **** man!' 

Mrs. Bumble, ****** at a ******, that the ******** ****** had now *******, and that a **** ****** for the ********** on one **** or other, must *********** be ***** and **********, no ****** ***** this ******** to the **** and ****, than she ******* into a *****, and with a **** ****** that Mr. Bumble was a ****-******* *****, **** into a ******** of *****. 

But, ***** were not the ****** to **** their way to Mr. ******'* ****; his ***** was **********.

He **** his good lady with ***** of great ************, and ******, in an *********** ******, that she should *** her *******:  the ******** being looked upon, by the *******, as ******** ********* to ******. 

'It ***** the *****, ****** the ***********, ********* the eyes, and ******* down the ******,' said Mr. Bumble.  'So *** away.' 

As he ********** himself of this **********, Mr. Bumble took his *** from a ***, and ******* it on, ****** ********, on one ****, as a man might, who **** he had ******** his *********** in a ******** ******, ****** his hands into his *******, and ********* ******* the door, with much **** and *********** ******** in his ***** **********.

'*** up!' said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of *******.  'And take ******** away from here, ****** you **** me to do ********* *********.' 

Mr. Bumble rose with a very ****** ***********:  ********* much what ********* ********* might be.  ******* up his ***, he looked ******* the door. 

'Are you *****?' ******** Mrs. Bumble.

At this *******, Mrs. Bumble ******* ******* ******* to ******* the ******, which had been ****** up in the *******.  Mr. Bumble *********** ****** out of the room, without ********* another thought on his ********** ********:  ******* the **** Mrs. ****** in **** ********** of the *****. 

Mr. Bumble was ****** ***** by ********, and ****** ******.  He had a ******* ********** for ********:  ******* no ************** ******** from the ******** of ***** *******; and, ************, was (it is ******** to say) a ******.

'_You_ thought they were ******* too much?' said Mrs. Bumble. 'What ******** is it of *****?'

It was too much.  Mr. Bumble ***** the **** of the boy who ****** the **** for him (for he had ******* the ****** in his *******); and ******, ************, into the ******. 

He ****** up one ******, and down another, ***** ******** had ****** the first ******* of his *****; and then the ********* of ******* made him *******.

'****** of the *********,' ******** Mr. Bumble, ****** and ************, to ***** any ***** *********** the ******** might ********* ******.  '****** of the *********, young man!' 

'You have the same *** to your own ********, that you ****** had, I ***** not?' ******* the ********, looking ****** into Mr. ******'* eyes, as he ****** them in ************ at the ********. 

'Don't ******* to ****** ******, man.  I know you ****** well, you see.' 

'I *******, a ******* man,' replied Mr. Bumble, ******* his eyes with his hand, and ********* the ********, from head to ****, in ******* **********, 'is not more ****** to ******* an ****** ***** when he can, than a ****** one.  ********* ******** are not so well **** that they can ****** to ****** any little ***** ***, when it ***** to them in a ***** and ****** ******.'

'Not too ******,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a ******** *****. 

'You ********** what that *****, ********!' said the ********, *****.

'I never ***** the ****,' said Rose. 

'Then he **** by some other ******* us,' ******** the girl, 'which I more than thought before.

'--That Monks,' ******* the girl, 'had **** him ********** with two of *** **** on the day we first **** him, and had ***** him ******** to be the same child that he was ******** for, ****** I ******'* make out why.

'He ****** ***** of my ****** on the **** as I ********, in the **** of ******* out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many ****** ******* me that could have got out of their way in time to ****** *********.  But I did; and I *** him no more **** **** night.' 

'And what ******** then?' 

'I'll tell you, lady.  **** night he came again.  Again they **** ********, and I, ******** ****** up so that my ****** would not ****** me, again ******** at the door.

'What is all this!' said Rose. 

'The *****, lady, ****** it ***** from my ****,' replied the girl. 'Then, he said, with ***** ****** ****** in my ****, but ******* to *****, that if he could ******* his ****** by ****** the ***'* life without ******** his own **** in ******, he would; but, as he ******'*, **'* be upon the ***** to **** him at every **** in life; and if he took ********* of his ***** and *******, he might **** him ***.

'His *******!' ********* Rose. 

'***** were his words,' said Nancy, ******** ******** round, as she had ******** ****** to do, ***** she ***** to *****, for a ****** of Sikes ******* her ***********.  'And more.

'You do not ****,' said Rose, ******* very ****, 'to tell me that this was said in *******?' 

'He ***** in **** and ***** *******, if a man **** did,' replied the girl, ******* her head.  'He is an ******* man when his ****** is up.

'Lady,' cried the girl, ******* on her *****, 'dear, *****, ***** lady, you _are_ the first that **** ******* me with such words as these, and if I had ***** them ***** ***, they might have turned me from a life of *** and ******; but it is too ****, it is too ****!'

'It is,' cried the girl, ******** in ***** of her mind; 'I ****** ***** him now!  I could not be his *****.' 

'Why should you be?' asked Rose. 

'Nothing could **** him,' cried the girl.  'If I **** ****** what I have **** you, and *** to their being *****, he would be **** to ***. He is the *******, and has been so *****!' 

'Is it ********,' cried Rose, 'that for such a man as this, you can ****** every ****** ****, and the ********* of ********* ******?  It is

'What am I to do?' said Rose.  'I should not let you ****** from me 



'You should, lady, and I know you will,' ******** the girl, ******. 'You will not **** my ***** ******* I have ******* in your ********, and ****** no ******* from you, as I might have done.' 

'Of what ***, then, is the ************* you have made?' said Rose. 'This ******* must be ************, or how will its ********** to me, ******* Oliver, **** you are ******* to *****?' 

'You must have some **** gentleman about you that will hear it as a ******, and ****** you what to do,' ******** the girl. 

'But where can I **** you again when it is *********?' asked Rose.  'I do not **** to know where these ******** ****** ****, but where will you be ******* or ******* at any ******* ****** from this time?' 

'Will you ******* me that you will have my ****** ******** ****, and come *****, or with the only other ****** that ***** it; and that I shall not be ******* or ********?' asked the girl. 

'I ******* you ********,' ******** Rose. 

'Every ****** night, from ****** ***** the ***** ******* ******,' said the girl without **********, 'I will **** on ****** ****** if I am

'Do not ***** your ***** ******* all my ******* to **** you,' said Rose, ******** ****** *******.  'I **** to ***** you ******.' 

'You would ***** me ****, lady,' replied the girl, ******** her hands, 'if you could take my life at once; for I have **** more ***** to think of what I am, **-*****, than I **** did before, and it would be ********* not to *** in the **** in which I have *****.  *** ***** you, ***** lady, and **** as much ********* on your head as I have ******* ***** on ****!'

********** ***** ***********, AND ******* THAT ********, LIKE ***********, ****** COME ***** 

Her ********* was, ******, one of no ****** ***** and **********. ***** she **** the most ***** and ******* ****** to ********* the ******* in which Oliver's ******* was *********, she could not but **** ****** the ********** which the ********* woman with **** she had **** *********, had ******* in her, as a young and ********* girl.

They ******** ********* in ****** only ***** ****, ***** to ********* for some ***** to a ******* **** of the *****.  It was now ******** of the first day.  What ****** of ****** could she ********* upon, which could be ******* in *****-***-***** *****? Or how could she ******** the ******* without ******** *********? 

Mr. ******** was with them, and would be for the **** two ****; but Rose was too well ********** with the ********* *********'* ***********, and ******* too ******* the ***** with which, in the first ********* of his ***********, he would ****** the ********** of Oliver's *********, to ***** him with the ******, when her *************** in the ****'* ****** could be ******** by no *********** ******.  These were all ******* for the ******** ******* and most *********** ********* in ************* it to Mrs. ******, ***** first ******* would ********** be to **** a ********** with the ****** doctor on the *******.  As to ********* to any ***** *******, even if she had ***** how to do so, it was ******** to be thought of, for the same ******.  Once the thought ******** to her of ******* ********** from *****; but this ******** the ************ of their **** *******, and it ****** ******** of her to **** him back, ****--*** ***** rose to her eyes as she ******* this ***** of **********--** might have by this time ****** to ****** her, and to be ******* away. 

********* by these ********* ***********; ********* now to one ****** and then to another, and again ********* from all, as **** ********** ************* ********* ****** to her mind; Rose ****** a ********* and ******* night.  After more ********* with ******* **** day, she ******* at the ********* ********** of ********** *****. 

'If it be ******* to him,' she thought, 'to come back here, how ******* it will be to me!  But ******* he will not come; he may *****, or he may come himself, and ********** ******* from ******* **--** did when he **** away.  I ****** thought he would; but it was better for us ****.'  And here Rose ******* the ***, and turned away, as ****** the very ***** which was to be her ********* should not see her ****. 

She had ***** up the same ***, and **** it down again ***** *****, and had ********** and ************ the first **** of her ****** without ******* the first ****, when Oliver, who had been ******* in the *******, with Mr. Giles for a ****-*****, ******* the room in such ********** ***** and ******* *********, as ****** to ******* some *** ***** of *****. 

'What ***** you look so ********?' asked Rose, ********* to **** him. 

'I ****** know how; I **** as if I should be ******,' replied the boy. 'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at ****, and you should be **** to know that I have **** you the *****!' 

'I never thought you had **** us ******** but the *****,' said Rose, ******** him.  'But what is ****?--** **** do you *****?' 

'I have **** the gentleman,' replied Oliver, ******** **** to **********, 'the gentleman who was so good to **--**. Brownlow, that we have so ***** ****** about.' 

'Where?' asked Rose. 

'******* out of a *****,' replied Oliver, ******** ***** of *******, 'and ***** into a house.  I ****'* ***** to ***--* ******'* ***** to him, for he ****'* see me, and I ******** so, that I was not **** to go up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, ******* he ***** there, and they said he did.  Look here,' said Oliver, ******* a ***** of *****, 'here it is; ****'* where he *****--*'* ***** there ********!  Oh, dear me, dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him ***** 



With her ********* not a little ********** by these and a great many other ********** ************ of ***, Rose **** the *******, which was ****** ******, in the ******.  She very **** ********** upon ******* the ********* to *******. 

'*****!' she said.  'Tell them to ***** a *******-*****, and be ***** to go with me.  I will take you there ********, without a ******'* **** of time.  I will only tell my **** that we are ***** out for an ****, and be ***** as **** as you are.' 

Oliver ****** no ********* to ********, and in little more than **** ******* they were on their way to ****** ******.  When they ******* there, Rose left Oliver in the *****, ***** ******** of ********* the old gentleman to ******* him; and ******* up her **** by the *******, ********* to see Mr. Brownlow on very ******** ********.  The ******* **** ********, to *** that she would **** ********; and ********* him into an ***** room, **** ****** was ********* to an ******* gentleman of ********** **********, in a ******-***** ****.  At no great ******** from ****, was ****** another old gentleman, in ******* ******** and *******; who did not look ************ **********, and who was ******* with his hands ******* on the *** of a ***** *****, and his **** ******* *********. 

'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the ******-***** ****, ******* ****** with great **********, 'I *** your ******, young ****--* ******** it was some *********** ****** ***--* *** you will ****** me.  Be ******, 



'Mr. Brownlow, I *******, sir?' said Rose, ******** from the other gentleman to the one who had ******. 

'That is my ****,' said the old gentleman.  'This is my ******, Mr. *******.  *******, will you ***** us for a few *******?' 

'I *******,' ********** **** ******, 'that at this ****** of *** *********, I **** not **** that gentleman the ******* of ***** away. If I am ********* ********, he is ********* of the ******** on which I **** to ***** to you.' 

Mr. Brownlow ******** his head.  Mr. *******, who had made one very ***** ***, and ***** from his *****, made another very ***** ***, and ******* into it again. 

'I shall ******** you very much, I have no *****,' said Rose, ********* ***********; 'but you once ****** great *********** and ******** to a very dear young ****** of ****, and I am **** you will take an ******** in ******* of him again.' 

'******!' said Mr. Brownlow. 

'Oliver ***** you **** him as,' replied Rose. 

The words no ****** ******* her ****, than Mr. *******, who had been ********* to *** into a ***** **** that *** on the *****, ***** it with a great *****, and ******* back in his *****, ********** from his ******** every ********** but one of *********** ******, and ******** in a ********* and ****** *****; then, as if ******* of having ******** so much *******, he ****** himself, as it were, by a ********** into his ****** ********, and looking out ******** before him ******* a long **** *******, which ******, at ****, not to be ********** on ***** ***, but to *** away in the ********* ******** of his *******. 

Mr. ******* was no **** *********, ******** his ************ was not ********* in the same ********* ******.  He **** his ***** ****** to **** ******'*, and said, 

'Do me the ******, my dear young lady, to ***** ******** out of the ******** that ******** and *********** of which you *****, and of which ****** **** ***** ********; and if you have it in your ***** to ******* any ******** which will ***** the ************ ******* I was once ******* to ********* of that **** child, in ******'* **** *** me in ********** of it.' 

'A *** one!  I'll *** my head if he is not a *** one,' ******* Mr. *******, ******** by some ************* *****, without ****** a ****** of his face. 

'He is a child of a ***** ****** and a **** *****,' said Rose, *********; 'and that ***** which has thought *** to *** him ****** his *****, has ******* in his ****** ********** and ******** which would do ****** to many who have ******** his **** *** ***** over.' 

'*'* only *****-***,' said Mr. *******, with the same ***** face. 'And, as the *****'* in it if this Oliver is not ****** ***** old at *****, I don't see the *********** of that ******.' 

'Do not **** my ******, **** ******,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'he **** not **** what he ****.' 

'Yes, he ****,' ******* Mr. *******. 

'No, he **** not,' said Mr. Brownlow, ********* ****** in ***** as he 



'**'** *** his head, if he *****'*,' ******* Mr. *******. 

'He would ******* to have it ******* off, if he ****,' said Mr. 



'And **'* ********** like to see any man ***** to do it,' ********* Mr. *******, ******** his ***** upon the *****. 

Having **** **** ***, the two old ********* ********* took *****, and ********** ***** hands, ********* to their ********** ******. 

'Now, **** ******,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to ****** to the ******* in which your ******** is so much **********.  Will you let me know what ************ you have of this **** child:  ******** me to ******* that I ********* every ***** in my ***** of *********** him, and that ***** I have been ****** from this *******, my first ********** that he had ******* upon me, and had been ********* by his ****** ********** to *** me, has been ************ ******.' 

Rose, who had had time to ******* her ********, at once *******, in a few ******* words, all that had ******** Oliver ***** he left Mr. ********'* house; ********* *****'* *********** for that *********'* ******* ***, and ********** with the ********* that his only ******, for some ****** ****, had been not being **** to **** with his ****** ********** and ******. 

'***** ***!' said the old gentleman.  'This is great ********* to me, great *********.  But you have not **** me where he is now, **** ******.  You must ****** my ******* ***** with ***,--*** why not have ******* him?' 

'He is ******* in a ***** at the door,' replied Rose. 

'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.  With which he ******* out of the room, down the ******, up the **********, and into the *****, without another ****. 

When the ****-**** ****** ****** him, Mr. ******* ****** up his head, and ********** one of the **** **** of his ***** into a *****, ********* ***** ******** ******* with the ********** of his ***** and the *****; ******* in it all the time.  After ********** this *********, he rose and ****** as **** as he could up and down the room at ***** a ***** *****, and then ******** ******** before Rose, ****** her without the ********* *******. 

'****!' he said, as the young lady rose in some ***** at this ******* **********.  'Don't be ******.  *'* old ****** to be your ***********. ***'** a ***** girl.  I like you.  Here they are!' 

In ****, as he ***** himself at one ********* **** into his ****** ****, Mr. Brownlow ********, *********** by Oliver, **** Mr. ******* ******** very **********; and if the ************* of that ****** had been the only ****** for all her ******* and **** in Oliver's ******, Rose ****** would have been well ******.

'No, not ****,' replied Mr. ********.  'There!  Not ****; so don't think it.' 

'Why not?' 

'When I tell *** that I don't **** to do a *****, that's ******, without any why or ******* ******,' replied Mr. ******** with *******. 

'Well, you *****'* be so *****,' said his *********. 

'A ****** ***** it would be, ******'* it to go and **** at the very first ******-***** ******* the ****, so that **********, if he come up after us, might **** in his old ****, and have us ***** back in a **** with ********* on,' said Mr. ******** in a ******* ****.

'*** took the ***** from the ****, *** know *** did,' said Mr. ********. 

'I took it for you, Noah, dear,' ******** *********. 

'Did I **** it?' asked Mr. ********. 

'No; you ******* in me, and let me ***** it like a dear, and so you are,' said the lady, ******** him ***** the ****, and ******* her *** through his. 

This was ****** the ****; but as it was not Mr. ********'* ***** to ****** a ***** and ******* ********** in *******, it should be ********, in ******* to that gentleman, that he had ******* ********* to this ******, in ***** that, if they were *******, the ***** might be ***** on her:  which would ***** him an *********** of ********* his ********* of any *****, and would ******* ********** his ******* of ******.  Of ******, he ******* at this ********, into no *********** of his *******, and they ****** on very ******** ********.

At ******, he ******* in ***** of one, more ****** in ********** and more ***** than any he had *** ****; and, having ******* over and ******** it from the ******** ********, ********** ********* his ********* of ******* up there, for the night. 

'So **** us the ******,' said Noah, *********** it from the *****'* *********, and ******** it over his own; 'and don't *** *****, ****** when *** ***** to.  ****'* the **** of the *****--*-*-*--***** what?'

There was ****** in the *** but a young Jew, who, with his two ****** on the *******, was ******* a ***** *********. He ****** very **** at Noah, and Noah ****** very **** at him. 

If Noah had been ******* in his *******-***'* *****, there might have been some ****** for the Jew ******* his eyes so ****; but as he had ********* the **** and *****, and **** a ***** *****-***** over his ********, there ****** no ********** ****** for his ********** ******** so much ********* in a ******-*****. 

'Is this the ***** ********?' asked Noah. 

'That is the **** of this '****,' replied the Jew. 

'A gentleman we *** on the ****, ****** up from the *******, *********** us here,' said Noah, ******* *********, ******* to **** her ********* to this most ********* ****** for ********** *******, and ******* to **** her to ****** no ********.  'We **** to ***** here

He again ******* his *** to the *****, and ******* his *** to the *********, ******** ***********:  with a ****** and ***** look upon his face, that might have *********** to some old ******. 

'So I **** to be a gentleman,' said Mr. ********, ******* out his ****, and ********** a ************, the ************ of which Fagin had ******* too **** to hear. 'No more ***** old *******, *********, but a *********'* life for me:  and, if *** like, *** shall be a lady.' 

'I should like that well ******, dear,' replied *********; 'but ***** ***'* to be ******* every day, and ****** to *** ***** off after it.' 

'***** be ******!' said Mr. ********; '*****'* more ****** ******* ***** to be *******.' 

'What do you ****?' asked his *********.

'But you ***'* do all that, dear,' said *********. 

'I shall look out to *** into ******* with them as can,' replied Noah. '****'** be **** to make us ****** some way or another. Why, you ******** are ***** ***** *****; I never see such a ******** *** and ********* ******* as *** can be when I let ***.'

Mr. ******** no ****** ***** this ******* from his own ******* than he **** back in his *****, and looked from the Jew to ********* with a *********** of **** ******** and ********* ******. 

'Don't mind me, my dear,' said Fagin, ******* his ***** ******. '**! **! it was ***** it was only me that ***** you by ******. It was very ***** it was only me.'

'Well, I ******* it is,' ******* Sikes.  'I thought I had ***** her, but ***'* as *** as ****.' 

'*****,' said Fagin ************.  'I never **** her like this, for such a little *****.' 

'*** I,' said Sikes.  'I think ***'* got a ***** of that ***** in her ***** ***, and it ***'* come ***--**?' 

'Like ******.' 

'I'll let her a little *****, without ********* the doctor, if ***'* took that way again,' said Sikes. 

Fagin ****** an ********** ******** of this **** of *********. 

'She was ******* about me all day, and night too, when I was ********* on my back; and you, like a ************ **** as you are, **** ******** *****,' said Sikes.  'We was **** too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it's ******* and ******* her; and that being **** up here so long has made her ********--**?' 

'That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a *******.  '****!' 

As he ******* these words, the girl ******* ******** and ******* her ****** ****.  Her eyes were ******* and ***; she ****** ******* to and ***; ****** her head; and, after a little time, ***** out ********. 

'Why, now ***'* on the other ****!' ********* Sikes, ******* a look of ********* ******** on his *********. 

Fagin ****** to him to take no ******* ****** **** then; and, in a few *******, the girl ******** into her ********** *********. ********** Sikes that there was no **** of her *********, Fagin took up his *** and **** him ****-*****.  He ****** when he ******* the ****-****, and looking round, asked if ******** would ***** him down the **** ******. 

'***** him down,' said Sikes, who was ******* his ****. 'It's a **** he should ***** his **** himself, and ********** the *****-*****.  **** him a *****.' 

Nancy ******** the old man **********, with a ******.  When they ******* the *******, he **** his ****** on his ***, and ******* ***** to the girl, said, in a *******. 

'What is it, Nancy, dear?' 

'What do you ****?' replied the girl, in the same ****. 

'The ****** of all this,' replied Fagin.  'If _**_'--** ******* with his ****** ****-****** up the ******--'** so **** with you (**'* a *****, *****, a *****-*****), why don't you--' 

'Well?' said the girl, as Fagin ******, with his ***** ****** ******** her ***, and his eyes looking into ****. 

'No ****** **** now.  We'll **** of this again.  You have a ****** in me, *****; a ******* ******.  I have the ***** at hand, ***** and *****.  If you **** ******* on ***** that ***** you like a ***--**** a ***!  ***** than his ***, for he ******* him *********--**** to me.  I say, come to me.  He is the **** ***** of a day, but you know me of old, *****.' 

'I know you well,' replied the girl, without *********** the ***** *******.  '****-*****.' 

She ****** back, as Fagin ******* to *** his hand on ****, but said ****-***** again, in a ****** voice, and, ********* his ******* look with a *** of ************, ****** the door ******* them. 

Fagin ****** ******* his ****, ****** upon the ******** that were ******* ****** his *****.

The ****** of this *** ****** was not ***** his *********.  He would be a ******** *********** with such an ********* as Nancy, and must (**** Fagin ******) be ******* without *****. 

There was another, and a ****** ******, to be ******.  Sikes **** too much, and his ******* ****** had not ****** Fagin the ****, ******* the ****** were ******.  The girl must know, well, that if she ***** him off, she could never be **** from his ****, and that it would be ****** *******--** the ******* of *****, or ******* the **** of ****--** the ****** of her more ****** *****. 

'With a little **********,' thought Fagin, 'what more ****** than that she would ******* to ****** him?  ***** have done such ******, and *****, to ****** the same ****** before now.  There would be the ********* *******:  the man I ****:  ****; another ******* in his place; and my ********* over the girl, with a ********* of this ***** to back it, *********.'

At *****, he turned, with ********* *************, ******** to **** this ******* off, ****** it should look him ****; but the **** rose on his head, and his ***** ***** *****, for it had turned with him and was ****** him then.  He had **** it before him that *******, but it was ****** ***--******.  He ****** his back ******* a ****, and **** that it ***** ***** him, ******* out ******* the **** *****-***.

If he **** out the *****, there came the room with every ****-***** ******--****, ******, that he would have *********, if he had **** over its ******** from ******--**** in its ********** place.  The **** was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he *** them when he ***** away.  He got up, and ****** into the ***** without.  The ****** was ****** him.

And here he ******** in such ****** as **** but he can know, ********* in every ****, and the **** ***** ******** from every ****, when ******** there ***** upon the *****-**** the ***** of ******* ********, and the **** of ****** ******* in ***** and ******.

********* AN *********** OF MORE ********* THAN ONE, AND ************* A ******** OF ******** WITH NO **** OF ********** OR ***-***** 

The ****** ******** in the **** ******* were *** but two **** old, when Oliver ***** himself, at ***** *'***** in the *********, in a **********-******** ******* **** ******* his ****** ****.  Mrs. ******, and Rose, and Mrs. ******, and the good doctor were with him:  and Mr. Brownlow ******** in a ****-******, *********** by one other ****** ***** **** had not been *********. 

They had not ****** much upon the way; for Oliver was in a ******* of ********* and *********** which ******** him of the ***** of ********** his ********, and ****** of ******, and ******** to have ******** **** ****** on his **********, who ****** it, in at ***** an ***** ******. He and the two ****** had been very ********* made ********** by Mr. Brownlow with the ****** of the ********** which had been ****** from Monks; and ******** they **** that the ****** of their ******* ******* was to ******** the **** which had been so well *****, ***** the ***** ****** was ********* in ****** of ***** and ******* to ***** them in ********* of the most ******* ********. 

The same **** ****** had, with Mr. ********'* **********, ********** ******* all ******** of ************* through which they could ******* ************ of the ******** *********** that so ******** ***** place. 'It was ***** ****,' he said, 'that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the *******, and it could not be at a *****.'  So, they ********* on in *******:  **** ****** with *********** on the ****** which had ******* them ********:  and no one ******** to **** ********* to the ******** which ******* upon all. 

But if Oliver, ***** these **********, had ******** ****** ***** they ********* ******* his *****-***** by a **** he had never ****, how the ***** ******* of his ************* *** back to old *****, and what a ***** of ******** were ******* up in his ******, when they turned into that which he had ********* on ****:  a **** *********, ********* boy, without a ****** to **** him, or a **** to ******* his head. 

'See there, there!' cried Oliver, ******* ******** the hand of Rose, and ******** out at the ******** ******; 'that's the ***** I came over; there are the ****** I ***** ******, for **** any one should ******** me and ***** me back!  ****** is the **** ****** the ******, ******* to the old house where I was a little child!  Oh ****, ****, my dear old ******, if I could only see you now!' 

'You will see him ****,' replied Rose, ****** ****** his ****** hands ******* her own.  'You shall tell him how ***** you are, and how **** you have *****, and that in all your ********* you have **** so great as the ****** back to make him ***** too.' 

'Yes, yes,' said Oliver, 'and **'**--**'** take him away from here, and have him ******* and ******, and **** him to some ***** ******* place where he may **** ****** and ****,--***** we?' 

Rose ****** 'yes,' for the boy was ******* through such ***** ***** that she could not *****. 

'You will be **** and good to him, for you are to every one,' said Oliver.  'It will make you ***, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will ***** *****--* know that ***--** think how ******* he is; you did the same with me.  He said "*** ***** you" to me when I *** away,' cried the boy with a ***** of ************ *******; 'and I will say "*** ***** you" now, and **** him how I **** him for it!' 

As they ********** the ****, and at ****** ***** through its ****** *******, it ****** ****** of no ***** ********** to ******** the boy ****** ********** ******.  There was **********'* the **********'* **** as it **** to be, only ******* and **** ******** in ********** than he ********** **--***** were all the ****-***** ***** and ******, with ****** every one of which he had some ****** ******** *********--***** was ********'* ****, the very **** he **** to have, ******** at the old ******-***** ****--***** was the *********, the ****** ****** of his ******** ****, with its ****** ******* ******** on the ******--***** was the same **** ****** ******** at the ****, at ***** of **** Oliver ************* ****** back, and then ******* at himself for being so *******, then cried, then ******* *****--***** were ****** of ***** at the ***** and ******* that he **** ***** ****--***** was ****** ********** as if he had left it but *********, and all his ****** life had been but a ***** *****. 

But it was ****, *******, ****** *******.  They ***** ******** to the door of the ***** ***** (which Oliver **** to ***** up at, with ***, and think a ****** ******, but which had ******* ****** off in ******** and ****); and here was Mr. ******* all ***** to ******* them, ******* the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the *****, as if he were the *********** of the ***** *****, all ****** and ********, and not ******** to *** his ****--**, not once; not even when he ************ a very old ******* about the ******* **** to ******, and ********** he **** it ****, ****** he had only come that way once, and that time **** ******.  There was ****** ********, and there were ******** *****, and ********** was ******** as if by *****. 

*************** all this, when the ***** of the first ****-**** was over, the same ******* and ********** ********* that had ****** their ******* down.  Mr. Brownlow did not **** them at ******, but ******** in a ******** room.  The two other ********* ******* in and out with ******* *****, and, ****** the ***** ********* when they were *******, ********* *****.  Once, Mrs. ****** was ****** away, and after being ****** for ****** an ****, ******** with eyes ******* with *******. All these ****** made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any *** *******, ******* and *************.  They *** *********, in *******; or, if they ********* a few words, ***** in ********, as if they were ****** to hear the ***** of their own ******. 

At ******, when **** *'***** had come, and they ***** to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. ******** and Mr. ******* ******* the room, ******** by Mr. Brownlow and a man **** Oliver ****** ******** with ******** to see; for they **** him it was his *******, and it was the same man he had *** at the ******-****, and **** looking in with Fagin at the ****** of his little room.  Monks **** a look of ****, which, even then, he could not *********, at the ********** boy, and *** down **** the door.  Mr. Brownlow, who had ****** in his hand, ****** to a ***** **** which Rose and Oliver were ******. 

'This is a ******* ****,' said he, 'but these ************, which have been ****** in ****** before many *********, must be in ********* ******** here.  I would have ****** you the ***********, but we must hear them from your own **** before we ****, and you know why.' 

'Go on,' said the ****** *********, ******* away his face. '*****.  I have ****** done ******, I think.  Don't **** me here.' 

'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* Oliver to him, and ****** his hand upon his head, 'is your ****-*******; the ************ *** of your ******, my dear ****** ***** *******, by **** young ***** *******, who **** in ****** him *****.' 

'Yes,' said Monks, ******** at the ********* boy:  the ******* of ***** ***** he might have *****.  'That is the ******* child.' 

'The **** you ***,' said Mr. Brownlow, *******, 'is a ******** to ***** long ***** ****** ****** the ****** ******* of the *****. It ******** ******** on no one ******, ****** you who *** it. Let that ****.  He was **** in this ****.' 

'In the ********* of this ****,' was the ****** *****. 'You have the ***** there.'  He ******* *********** to the ****** as he *****. 

'I must have it here, too,' said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the 



'****** then!  You!' ******** Monks.  'His ****** being ***** ill at ****, was ****** by his ****, my ******, from **** he had been long *********, who **** from ***** and took me with ***--** look after his ********, for what I know, for she had no great ********* for him, *** he for her.  He **** nothing of us, for his ****** were ****, and he ********* on **** **** day, when he ****.  ***** the ****** in his ****, were two, ***** on the night his ******* first came on, ******** to ********'; he ********* himself to Mr. Brownlow; 'and ******** in a few ***** ***** to you, with an ********** on the ***** of the ******* that it was not to be ********* **** after he was ****.  One of these ****** was a ****** to this girl *****; the other a will.' 

'What of the ******?' asked Mr. Brownlow. 

'The ******?--* ***** of ***** ******* and ******* again, with a ******** **********, and ******* to *** to **** her.  He had ****** a **** on the girl that some ****** *******--** be ********* one ***--********* his ******** her **** then; and so she had **** on, ******** ********* to him, ***** she ******* too ***, and **** what **** could **** **** her back.  She was, at that time, ****** a few ****** of her ***********.  He **** her all he had ***** to do, to **** her *****, if he had *****, and ****** her, if he ****, not to ***** his ******, or think the ************ of their *** would be ******* on her or their young child; for all the ***** was his.  He ******** her of the day he had ***** her the little ****** and the **** with her ********* **** ******** upon it, and a ***** left for that which he ***** one day to have ******** upon ***--****** her *** to **** it, and **** it **** her *****, as she had done ******--*** then *** on, ******, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had **** **********.  I ******* he had.' 

'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's ***** **** ****. 

Monks was ******. 

'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******** for him, 'was in the same ****** as the ******.  He ****** of ******** which his **** had ******* upon him; of the ********** ***********, ****, ******, and ********* *** ******** of you his only ***, who had been ******* to **** him; and left you, and your ******, **** an ******* of ***** ******* ******. The **** of his ******** he ******* into two ***** ********--*** for ***** *******, and the other for their child, if it should be **** *****, and **** come of ***.  If it were a girl, it was to ******* the ***** ***************; but if a boy, only on the *********** that in his ******** he should never have ******* his **** with any ****** *** of *********, ********, *********, or *****.  He did this, he said, to **** his ********** in the other, and his **********--**** ************ by *********** *****--**** the child would ***** her ****** *****, and ***** ******.  If he were ************ in this ***********, then the ***** was to come to you:  for then, and not **** then, when **** ******** were *****, would he ********* your ***** ***** upon his *****, who had **** upon his *****, but had, from an ******, ******** him with ******** and ********.' 

'My ******,' said Monks, in a ****** ****, 'did what a woman should have done.  She ***** this will.  The ****** never ******* its ***********; but that, and other ******, she ****, in **** they **** ***** to *** away the ****.  The ****'* ****** had the ***** from her with every *********** that her ******* ****--* **** her for it ***--***** ***.  ****** by ***** and ********* he **** with his ******** into a ****** ****** of *****, ******** his very **** that his ******* might never know of his *******; and here, no great ***** **********, he was ***** **** in his ***.  The girl had left her ****, in ******, some ***** before; he had ******** for her, on ****, in every **** and ******* ****; it was on the night when he ******** ****, ******* that she had ********* *******, to **** her ***** and his, that his old ***** *****.' 

There was a ***** ******* here, ***** Mr. Brownlow took up the ****** of the *********. 

'***** after this,' he said, 'this ***'*--****** *******'*--****** came to me.  He had left her, when only ********; ****** her of ****** and *****; *******, **********, ******, and **** to ******:  where for two ***** he had ********** with the ****** ********.  She was ******* ***** a ******* and ********* *******, and ****** to ******* him before she ****.  ********* were *** on ****, and ****** ******** made. They were ********** for a long time, but ********** **********; and he **** back with her to ******.' 

'There she ****,' said Monks, 'after a ********* *******; and, on her *****-***, she ********** these ******* to me, ******** with her ************ and ****** ****** of all **** they ********--****** she **** not have left me that, for I had ********* it long before.  She would not ******* that the girl had ********* *******, and the child too, but was ****** with the ********** that a **** child had been ****, and was *****.  I ***** to her, if **** it ******* my ****, to **** it down; never to let it ****; to ****** it with the ********* and most *********** *********; to **** upon it the ****** that I ****** ****, and to **** upon the ***** ***** of that ********* will by ******* it, if I could, to the very *******-****.  She was *****. He came in my way at ****.  I ***** well; and, but for ******** *****, I would have ******** as I *****!' 

As the ******* ****** his **** ***** ********, and ******** ****** on himself in the ********* of ******* ******, Mr. Brownlow turned to the ********* ***** ****** him, and ********* that the Jew, who had been his old ********** and *********, had a ***** ****** for ******* Oliver ********:  of which some **** was to be ***** up, in the ***** of his being *******:  and that a ******* on this head had *** to their ***** to the ******* house for the ******* of *********** him. 

'The ****** and ****?' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* to Monks. 

'I ****** them from the man and woman I **** you of, who ***** them from the *****, who ***** them from the ******,' ******** Monks without ******* his eyes.  'You know what ****** of them.' 

Mr. Brownlow ****** ****** to Mr. *******, who ************ with great ********, ******* ********, ******* in Mrs. Bumble, and ******** her ********* ******* after him. 

'Do my hi's ******* me!' cried Mr. Bumble, with ***-******* **********, 'or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you ****'* how *'** been *-******** for you--' 

'**** your ******, ****,' ******** Mrs. Bumble. 

'***'* *****, *****, Mrs. Bumble?' ************ the ********* ******. '***'* I be ******** to ****--_*_ as ******* him up ***********--**** I see him *-******* here ***** ****** and ********* of the very ********* ***********!

'Come, sir,' said Mr. *******, ******; '******** your ********.' 

'I will do my **********, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'How do you do, sir?  I **** you are very well.' 

This ********** was ********* to Mr. Brownlow, who had ******* up to ****** a ***** ******** of the *********** ******.  He inquired, as he ******* to Monks, 

'Do you know that ******?' 

'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble ******. 

'******* _you_ don't?' said Mr. Brownlow, ********** her ******. 

'I never *** him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble. 

'*** **** him ********, *******?' 

'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble. 

'You never had, *******, a ******* **** ****** and ****?' said Mr. 



'********* not,' replied the ******.  'Why are we ******* here to ****** to such ******** as this?' 

Again Mr. Brownlow ****** to Mr. *******; and again that gentleman ****** away with ************* *********.  But not again did he ****** with a ***** man and ****; for this time, he *** in two ******* *****, who ***** and ******** as they ******. 

'You **** the door the night old ***** ****,' said the ******** one, ******* her ********** hand, 'but you ******'* **** out the *****, *** **** the ******.' 

'No, no,' said the other, looking round her and ******* her ********* ****.  'No, no, no.' 

'We ***** her *** to tell you what ***'* done, and *** you take a ***** from her hand, and ******* you too, **** day, to the **********'* ****,' said the first. 

'Yes,' ***** the ******, 'and it was a "****** and **** ****." We ***** out that, and *** it ***** you.  We were by.  Oh! we were by.' 

'And we know more than that,' ******* the first, 'for she **** us *****, long ***, that the young ****** had **** her that, ******* she should never *** over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was ***** ill, to *** **** the ***** of the ****** of the child.' 

'Would you like to see the ********** himself?' asked Mr. ******* with a ****** ******* the door. 

'No,' replied the woman; 'if **--*** ******* to *****--'*** been ****** ****** to *******, as I see he has, and you have ******* all these **** **** you have ***** the ***** ****, I have nothing more to say.  I _did_ **** them, and ****'** where ***'** never *** them.  What then?' 

'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, '****** that it ******* for us to take **** that ******* of you is ******** in a ********* of ***** again. You may ***** the room.' 

'I ****,' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great **********, as Mr. ******* *********** with the two old *****: 'I **** that this *********** little ************ will not ******* me of my ********* 



'****** it will,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'You may make up your mind to that, and think ******** well off *******.' 

'It was all Mrs. Bumble.  She _would_ do it,' ***** Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ********* that his ******* had left the room. 

'That is no ******,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'You were ******* on the ******** of the *********** of these ********, and ****** are the more ****** of the two, in the *** of the ***; for the *** ******** that your **** **** ***** your *********.' 

'If the *** ******** that,' said Mr. Bumble, ********* his *** ************ in **** hands, 'the *** is a ***--* *****.  If that's the *** of the ***, the *** is a ********; and the ***** I **** the *** is, that his *** may be ****** by **********--** **********.'

'Young lady,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* to Rose, '**** me your hand. Do not *******.  You **** not **** to hear the few ********* words we have to say.' 

'If they ****--* do not know how they can, but if they ****--*** ********* to me,' said Rose, '**** let me hear them at some other time. I have not ******** or ******* now.' 

'***,' ******** the old ********, ******* her *** through his; 'you have more ********* than this, I am ****.  Do you know this young lady, 



'Yes,' replied Monks. 

'I never *** you before,' said Rose *******. 

'I have **** you *****,' ******** Monks. 

'The ****** of the ******* ***** had _two_ *********,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'What was the **** of the *****--*** child?' 

'The child,' replied Monks, 'when her ****** **** in a ******* place, in a ******* ****, without a ******, ****, or ***** of ***** that ******* the ******** **** by which his ******* or ********* could be ******--*** child was ***** by some ******** *********, who ****** it as their own.' 

'Go on,' said Mr. Brownlow, ******* to Mrs. ****** to ********. 'Go on!' 

'You ******'* **** the **** to which these ****** had ********,' said Monks, 'but where ********** *****, ****** will ***** ***** a way.  My ****** ***** it, after a **** of ******* ******--**, and ***** the

'Do you see her now?' 

'Yes.  ******* on your ***.' 

'But not the **** my *****,' cried Mrs. ******, ******* the ******** girl in her ****; 'not the **** my ******* child.  I would not **** her now, for all the ********* of the *****.  My ***** *********, my own dear girl!' 

'The only ****** I **** had,' cried Rose, ******** to her. 'The *******, **** of *******.  My ***** will *****.  I ****** **** all

'I know it all,' he said, ****** a **** ****** the ****** girl. 'Dear Rose, I know it all.' 

'I am not here by ********,' he ***** after a ********** *******; '*** have I ***** all this **-*****, for I **** it *********--**** *********.  Do you ***** that I have come to ****** you of a *******?'

'The same ******* which ********** me then, will ********* me now,' said Rose ******.  'If I **** **** a ****** and ***** **** to her, ***** ******** ***** me from a life of ********* and *********, when should I **** **** it, as I should **-*****?

*****'* **** NIGHT ***** 

The ***** was *****, from ***** to ****, with ***** *****. *********** and ***** eyes ****** from every **** of *****. From the **** before the ****, away into the ******** ***** of the ******** ****** in the *********, all ***** were ***** upon one ***--*****.  Before him and ******:  *****, *****, on the ***** and on the left:  he ****** to ***** ********** by a *********, all ****** with ******** eyes. 

He ***** there, in all this ***** of ****** *****, with one hand ******* on the ****** **** before him, the other **** to his ***, and his head ****** ******* to ****** him to ***** with ******* ************ every **** that **** from the ********* *****, who was ********** his ****** to the ****.  At *****, he turned his eyes ******* upon them to ******* the ****** of the ********* ************* in his ******; and when the ****** ******* him were ****** with ******** ************, looked ******* his *******, in **** ****** that he would, even then, **** ********* in his ******.  ****** these ************** of *******, he ******* not hand or ****.  He had ******** ***** ***** the ***** *****; and now that the ***** ****** to *****, he ***** ******** in the same ******** ******** of ***** *********, with his **** **** on him, as ****** he ******** *****. 

A ****** ****** in the *****, ******** him to himself.  Looking round, he *** that the ******* had turned ********, to ******** their *******. As his eyes ******** to the *******, he could see the ****** ****** ***** **** other to see his face:  some ******* ******** their ******* to their eyes:  and ****** ********** their ********** with ***** ********** of **********.  A few there were, who ****** ********* of him, and looked only to the ****, in ********* ****** how they could *****.  But in no one ****--*** even ***** the *****, of **** there were many *****--***** he **** the ******** ******** with himself, or any ******* but one of ***-********* ******** that he should be 



As he *** all this in one ********** ******, the ********* ********* came again, and looking back he *** that the ******* had turned ******* the *****.  ****! 

They only ****** ********** to ******. 

He looked, *********, into their *****, one by one when they ****** out, as ****** to see which way the ******* ****** *****; but that was *********.  The ****** ******* him on the ********. He ******** ************ to the *** of the ****, and *** down on a *****.  The man ******* it out, or he would not have **** it. 

He looked up into the ******* again.  Some of the ****** were ******, and some ******* ********** with *************; for the ******* place was very ***.  There was one young man ********* his face in a little ****-****.  He ******** ******* it was like, and looked on when the ****** ***** his ******-*****, and made another with his *****, as any **** ********* might have done. 

In the same way, when he turned his eyes ******* the *****, his mind ***** to **** ****** with the ******* of his *****, and what it ****, and how he *** it on.  There was an old *** gentleman on the *****, too, who had **** out, some **** an **** before, and now come back.  He ******** ****** himself ******* this man had been to *** his ******, what he had had, and where he had had it; and ******* this ***** of ******** thought ***** some *** ****** ****** his *** and ****** 



Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an *******, **** from one ********** ************ ***** of the ***** that ****** at his ****; it was **** ******* to him, but in a ***** and ******* way, and he could not *** his ******** upon it.  ****, even ***** he ********, and turned ******* *** at the **** of ****** *****, he **** to ******** the **** ****** before him, and ********* how the head of one had been ****** off, and ******* they would **** it, or ***** it as it was.  Then, he thought of all the ******* of the ******* and the ********--*** ******* to ***** a man ********** the ***** to **** **--*** then **** on to think again. 

At ****** there was a *** of *******, and a ********** look from all ******* the door.  The **** ********, and ****** him *****. He could ***** nothing from their *****; they might as well have been of *****. ******* ********* ******--*** a ******--*** a ******--******. 

The ******** **** with a ********** *****, and another, and another, and then it ****** **** ******, that ******** ******** as they ******* out, like ***** *******.  It was a **** of *** from the ******** *******, ******** the **** that he would *** on ******. 

The ***** ********, and he was asked if he had ******** to say why ******** of ***** should not be ****** upon him. He had ******* his ********* ********, and looked ******** at his ********** ***** the ****** was made; but it was ***** ******** before he ****** to hear it, and then he only ******** that he was an old ***--** old ***--*** so, ******** into a *******, was ****** again. 

The ***** ******* the ***** ***, and the ******** ***** ***** with the same *** and *******.  A woman in the *******, ******* some ***********, ****** ***** by this ***** *********; he looked ******* up as if ***** at the ************, and **** ******* *** more ***********. The ******* was ****** and **********; the ******** ******* to hear. But he *****, like a ****** ******, without the ****** of a *****.  His ******* face was ***** ****** *******, his *****-*** ******* down, and his eyes ******* out before him, when the ****** *** his hand upon his ***, and ******** him away.  He ***** ******** about him for an *******, and ******. 

They *** him through a ***** room ***** the *****, where some ********* were ******* **** their ***** came, and ****** were ******* to their *******, who ******* round a ***** which looked into the **** ****. There was ****** there to ***** to _him_; but, as he ******, the ********* **** back to ****** him more ******* to the ****** who were ******** to the ****:  and they ******** him with *********** *****, and ********* and ******.  He ***** his ****, and would have **** upon them; but his ********** ******* him on, through a ****** ******* ******* by a few *** *****, into the ******** of the ******. 

Here, he was ********, that he might not have about him the ***** of ************ the ***; this ******** *********, they *** him to one of the ********* *****, and left him *****--*****. 

He *** down on a ***** ***** ******** the door, which ****** for **** and ********; and ******* his *****-**** eyes upon the ******, ***** to ******* his ********. After ******, he ***** to ******** a few ********** ********* of what the ***** had said: ****** it had ****** to him, at the time, that he could not hear a ****.  These ********* **** into their ****** ******, and by ******* ********* more:  so that in a little time he had the *****, ****** as it was *********.  To be ****** by the ****, **** he was ****--**** was the ***.  To be ****** by the **** **** he was ****. 

As it came on very ****, he ***** to think of all the *** he had ***** who had **** upon the ********; some of them through his *****.  They rose up, in such ***** **********, that he could ****** ***** them.  He had **** some of them ***,--*** had ***** too, ******* they **** with ******* upon their ****.  With what a ******** ***** the **** **** down; and how ******** they *******, from ****** and ******** *** to ******** ***** of *******! 

Some of them might have ********* that very ****--*** upon that very ****.  It was very ****; why ****'* they ***** a *****?  The **** had been ***** for many *****.  ****** of *** must have ****** their **** ***** there.  It was like ******* in a ***** ****** with **** ******--*** ***, the *****, the ******** ****, the ***** that he ****, even ******* that ******* ****.--*****, *****! 

At ******, when his hands were *** with ******* ******* the ***** door and *****, two *** ********:  one ******* a ******, which he ****** into an **** *********** ***** ******* the ****:  the other ******** in a ******** on which to **** the night; for the ******** was to be left ***** no more. 

Then came the *****--****, ******, ****** night.  Other ******** are **** to hear this ******-***** ******, for they tell of life and ****** day.  To him they ******* *******.  The **** of every **** **** came ***** with the one, ****, ****** *****--*****. What ******* the ***** and ****** of ******** *******, which ********** even there, to him? It was another **** of *****, with ******* ***** to the *******. 

The day ****** off.  Day?  There was no day; it was **** as **** as ****--*** night came on again; night so long, and *** so *****; long in its ******** *******, and ***** in its ******** *****.  At one time he ***** and **********; and at another ****** and **** his ****. ********* *** of his own ********** had come to **** ****** him, but he had ****** them away with ******.  They ******* their ********** *******, and he **** them off. 

******** night.  He had only one night more to ****.  And as he thought of this, the day *****--******. 

It was not ***** the night of this **** ***** day, that a ********* ***** of his ********, ********* ***** came in its **** ********* upon his ******** ****; not that he had **** **** any ******* or ******** **** of *****, but that he had never been **** to ******** more than the *** *********** of ***** so ****. He had ****** little to ****** of the two ***, who ******** **** other in their ********** upon him; and they, for their *****, made no ****** to ***** his *********.  He had *** there, *****, but ********.  Now, he ******* up, every ******, and with ******* ***** and ******* ****, ******* to and ***, in such a ******** of **** and ***** that even ****--**** to such ******--******** from him with ******.  He **** so ********, at ****, in all the ******** of his **** **********, that one man could not **** to *** there, ****** him *****; and so the two **** ***** ********. 

He ******* down upon his ***** ***, and thought of the ****. He had been ******* with some ******** from the ***** on the day of his *******, and his head was ******** with a ***** *****.  His *** **** **** down upon his ********* face; his ***** was ****, and ******* into *****; his eyes ***** with a ******** *****; his ******** ***** ******** with the ***** that ***** him up. *****--****--****.  If it was not a ***** to ******** him, and ***** were the **** ***** ******** on **** *****'* *****, where would he be, when they came round again! ******!  Another ******, before the voice of the ******** **** had ****** to *******.  At *****, he would be the only ******* in his own ******* *****; at ******-- 

***** ******** ***** of *******, which have ****** so much ****** and such *********** *******, not only from the eyes, but, too *****, and too long, from the ********, of ***, never **** so ***** a ********* as that.  The few who ******** as they ******, and ******** what the man was ***** who was to be ****** **-******, would have ***** but ill that night, if they could have **** him. 

From ***** in the ******* ***** ****** ********, little ****** of two and ***** ********* ********** at the *****-****, and inquired, with ******* *****, ******* any ******** had been ********.  These being ******** in the ********, ************ the ******* ************ to ******** in the ******, who ******* out to one another the door from which he must come out, and ****** where the ******** would be *****, and, ******* with ********* ***** away, turned back to ******* up the *****.  By ******* they **** off, one by one; and, for an ****, in the **** of night, the ****** was left to ******** and ********. 

The ***** before the ****** was *******, and a few ****** ********, ******* *****, had been ******* ****** ****** the **** to ***** the ******** of the ******** *****, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver ******** at the ******, and ********* an ***** of ********* to the ********, ****** by one of the ********.  They were *********** ******** into the

'It is not ******, my ******,' ******** Mr. Brownlow; 'but my ******** with this man is ********** ********* with him; and as this child has **** him in the **** ****** of his ******* and ********, I think it as ****--**** at the **** of some **** and ****--**** he should see him 



These few words had been said *****, so as to be ********* to Oliver. The man ******* his ***; and ******** at Oliver with some **********, ****** another ****, ******** to that by which they had *******, and *** them on, through **** and ******* ****, ******* the *****. 

'This,' said the man, ******** in a ****** ******* where a ****** of ******* were ****** some ************ in ******** *******--'**** is the place he ****** through.  If you **** this way, you can see the door he **** out at.' 

He *** them into a ***** *******, ****** with ******* for ******** the ****** ****, and ******* to a door.  There was an **** ******* ***** it, through which came the ***** of ***'* ******, ******* with the ***** of *********, and the ******** down of ******.  There were ******* up the ********.

They did so. 

The ********* ******** was ****** on his ***, ******* himself from **** to ****, with a *********** more like that of a ****** ***** than the face of a man.  His mind was ********* ********* to his old life, for he ********* to ******, without ********* ********* of their ******** ********* than as a **** of his ******.

'You have some ******,' said Mr. Brownlow *********, 'which were ****** in your hands, for better ********, by a man ****** Monks.' 

'It's all a *** ********,' replied Fagin.  'I *****'* ***--*** one.'

'I am not ******,' said Oliver in a *** voice, as he ************ Mr. ********'* hand.

'Have you nothing **** to *** him, sir?' inquired the *******. 

'No other ********,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'If I ***** we could ****** him to a ***** of his ********--'

******* **** 

AND **** 

The ******** of ***** who have ******* in this **** are ****** ******. The little that ******* to their ********* to ******, is **** in few and ****** words. 

Before ***** ****** had ******, Rose ******* and ***** ****** were ******* in the ******* ****** which was ********** to be the ***** of the young *********'* *******; on the same day they ******* into ********** of their *** and ***** ****. 

Mrs. ****** took up her ***** with her *** and ********-**-***, to *****, ****** the ******** ********* of her ****, the ******** ******** that *** and ***** can ****--*** ************* of the ********* of ***** on **** the ******* ********** and ********* ***** of a ****-***** life, have been *********** ********. 

It ********, on **** and ******* *************, that if the ***** of ******** ********* in the ******* of Monks (which had never ********* ****** in his hands or in ***** of his ******) were ******* ******* ******* himself and Oliver, it would *****, to ****, little more than ***** ******** ******.  By the ********** of his ******'* will, Oliver would have been ******** to the *****; but Mr. Brownlow, ********* to ******* the ***** *** of the *********** of ********** his ****** ***** and ******** an ****** ******, ******** this **** of ************, to which his young ****** ******** *******. 

Monks, ***** ******* that ******* ****, ******* with his ******* to a ******* **** of the *** *****; where, having ******* ********** it, he once more **** into his old *******, and, after ********** a long *********** for some ***** *** of ***** and *******, at ****** **** ***** an ****** of his old ********, and **** in ******.  As *** from ****, **** the ***** ********* ******* of his ****** *****'* ****. 

Mr. Brownlow ******* Oliver as his ***.  ******** with him and the old *********** to ****** a **** of the *********-*****, where his dear ******* *******, he ********* the only ********* **** of Oliver's **** and ******* *****, and **** ****** ******** a little *******, ***** ********* ********** as ****** to one of ******* ********* as can **** be ***** in this ******** *****. 

**** after the ******** of the young ******, the ****** doctor ******** to ********, where, ****** of the ******** of his old *******, he would have been ************ if his *********** had ******** of such a *******; and would have turned ***** ******* if he had ***** how.  For two or ***** ******, he ********* himself with ******* that he ****** the *** ***** to ******** with him; then, ******* that the place ****** no ****** was, to him, what it had been, he ******* his ******** on his *********, took a ********'* ******* ******* the ******* of which his young ****** was ******, and *************** *********.  Here he took to *********, ********, *******, ************, and ******* other ******** of a ******* ****:  all ********** with his ************** ***********.  In **** and all he has ***** ****** ****** ********** the ************, as a most ******** *********. 

Before his *******, he had ******* to ******** a ****** ********** for Mr. *******, which that ********* gentleman ********* ************.  He is *********** ******* by Mr. ******* a great many ***** in the ****** of the ****.  On all such *********, Mr. ******* ******, ******, and **********, with great ******; ***** ********** in a very ******** and ************* ******, but ****** *********** with his ********* ************, that his **** is the ***** one.  On *******, he never ***** to ********* the ****** to the young *********'* face:  ****** ********* Mr. ********, in ****** ********** **********, that he ********* it an ********* ***********, but ***** it as well not to say so.  It is a ******** and very ********* ****, for Mr. Brownlow to ***** him on his old ******** ********** Oliver, and to ****** him of the night on which they *** with the ***** ******* them, ******* his ******; but Mr. ******* ******** that he was ***** in the ****, and, in ***** *******, ******* that Oliver did not come back after all; which ****** ***** ***** a ***** on his ****, and ********* his good ******. 

Mr. Noah ********:  ********* a **** ****** from the ***** in *********** of being ******** ******** ******* Fagin:  and *********** his ********** not ********** as **** a one as he could ****:  was, for some little time, at a **** for the ***** of a **********, not ******** with too much ****.  After some *************, he **** into ******** as an ********, in which ******* he ******** a ******* ***********.  His **** is, to **** out once a **** ****** ****** time ******** by ********* in *********** ******.  The lady ****** away at the ***** of ********** *********, and the gentleman being ************ with *****-***** ***** of ****** to ******* her, **** an *********** **** day, and ******* **** the *******.  ********* Mr. ******** ****** himself, but the ****** is the same. 

Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, ******** of their **********, were ********* ******* to great ********* and ******, and ******* ****** ******* in that very same ********* in which they had once ****** it over ******. Mr. Bumble has been ***** to say, that in this ******* and ***********, he has not even ******* to be ******** for being ********* from his 



As to Mr. Giles and ********, they ***** ****** in their old *****, ******** the ****** is ****, and the ****-***** boy ***** ****.  They ***** at the *********, but ****** their ********** so ******* ***** its *******, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. ********, that to this day the ********* have never been **** to ******** to which ************* they ******** ******. 

****** ******* *****, ******** by *****'* *****, **** into a ***** of ********** ******* an ****** life was not, after all, the ****. ******** at the ********** that it ********* was, he turned his back upon the ****** of the ****, ******** to ***** it in some *** ****** of ******.  He ********* ****, and ******** much, for some time; but, having a ********* ***********, and a good *******, ********* in the ***; and, from being a ******'* ******, and a *******'* ***, he is now the ******** young ******* in all ****************. 

And now, the hand that ****** these words, *******, as it ********** the ********** of its ****; and would *****, for a little ****** *****, the ****** of these **********. 

I would **** ****** *** with a few of ***** ***** **** I have so long *****, and ***** their ********* by ************ to ****** it.  I would **** Rose ****** in all the ***** and ***** of ***** *********, ******** on her ******** **** in life **** and ****** *****, that **** on all who **** it with her, and ***** into their ******.  I would ***** her the life and *** of the ****-**** ****** and the ****** ****** *****; I would ****** her through the ****** ****** at ****, and hear the *** ***** of her ***** voice in the ******* ******* ****; I would ***** her in all her ******** and ******* ******, and the ******* ******** ********* of ******** ****** at ****; I would ***** her and her **** ******'* child ***** in their **** for one another, and ******* ***** ***** ******** in ********* the ******* **** they had so ***** ****; I would ****** before me, once again, ***** ****** little ***** that ********* round her ****, and ****** to their ***** *******; I would ****** the ***** of that ***** *****, and ******* up the ************ **** that ********* in the **** **** ***.  These, and a ******** ***** and ******, and ***** of thought and ******--* would **** ****** them every one. 

How Mr. Brownlow **** on, from day to day, ******* the mind of his ******* child with ****** of *********, and ******** ******** to him, more and more, as his ****** ********* ******, and ****** the ******** ***** of all he ****** him to ******--*** he ****** in him *** ****** of his ***** ******, that ******** in his own ***** old ************, ********** and *** ***** and ********--*** the two *******, ***** by *********, ********** its ******* in ***** to ******, and ****** ****, and ******* ****** to Him who had ********* and ********* ****--***** are all ******* which **** not to be ****.  I have said that they were ***** *****; and without ****** ********* and ******** of *****, and ********* to that Being ***** **** is *****, and ***** great ********* is *********** to all ****** that *******, ********* can never be

There is no ****** in that ****; and may it be many, many *****, before another **** is ****** ***** it!  But, if the ******* of the **** **** come back to *****, to ***** ***** ******** by the ****--*** **** ****** the *****--** ***** **** they **** in life, I ******* that the ***** of ***** ********* ****** round that ****** ****.
